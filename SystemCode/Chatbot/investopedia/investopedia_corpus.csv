0,Abandonment Clause,"An abandonment clause in a property insurance contract, under certain circumstances, permits the property owner to abandon lost or damaged property and still claim a full settlement amount. If the insured party's property cannot be recovered, or the cost to recover or repair it is more than its total value, it can be abandoned and the insured party is entitled to a full settlement amount.","The abandonmentclause typically comes into play with marine property insurance, such as boats or watercraft. If a property owner's ship is sunk or lost at sea, the abandonment clause affords the owner the right to essentially ""give up"" on finding or recovering his or her property and subsequently collect a full insurance settlement from the insurer."
1,Abandonment and Salvage,Abandonment and salvage describes the forfeiture of property and the ensuing claim over that property by a second party.,"Abandonment and salvage can be added as a clause in an insurance contract, which gives the insurer the ability to accept the abandoned property. Abandonment must be expressed with intent. The potential financial rewards mean that salvage rights are sometimes legally contested by several parties. Salvage and abandonment clauses are usually found in marine insurance contracts."
2,Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS),"An Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS)is awritten request to Health Canada to obtain marketing approval for a generic drug. An Abbreviated New Drug Submission must be approved by Health Canada, the countrys federal department in charge of national health care, under Canadas Food and Drug regulations, before the generic drug can be marketed in the country. An ANDS provides the necessary information for the government agency to evaluate how safe and effective a generic drug is compared with its brand-name equivalent. The generic must be equally safe and effective to gain approval.","An Abbreviated New Drug Submission is used to obtain approval for generic drugs. This is in contrast to a New Drug Submission (NDS), which is used to obtain approval for a newbrand-name drug. An ANDSlists the related drugs brand name, chemical name, manufacturer name, dosage form(s) and strength(s). It states whether the drug has already been approved for marketing in the United States, the European Union, Switzerland, Singapore and/or Australia. It also addresses questionsabout drug impurities and drug stability."
3,Absolute Exclusion,"An absolute exclusion is an insurance policy clause that eliminates coverage of certain events. This type of clause allows insurers to deny coverage of claims regardless of how the event came to be, even if the claim only relates to the type of exclusion remotely. Insurers use absolute exclusions to clarify what events they will not cover in a policy, regardless of how an event comes to pass.","Insurance companies must provide policyholders with plainly worded forms that any absolute exclusions clear. If insurers willfully obscure or omit policy information or fail to provide clear, comprehensive forms, policyholders somteimtes take them to court for bad faith insurance practices."
4,Absolute Pollution Exclusion,"Absolute pollution exclusion is a commercial liability insurance policy clause that removes coverage of pollution that results from regular business operations. Absolute pollution exclusions to comprehensive general liability insurance policies became common after 1986, when standard pollution exclusions no longer containedsudden and accidental pollution incidents.","Absolute pollution exclusions came about in response to government regulations of environmentally harmful materials. Perhaps the most well-known case involved the Montrose Chemical Corporation of California, which produced dichlorodiphenyl- trichloroethane, commonly known as DDT. The company discharged waste into the Pacific Ocean for decades, and a federal lawsuit required the company to pay for the environmental cleanup costs resulting from the waste it produced."
5,Accelerated Benefits,"Accelerated benefits refers to aclause in certain life insurance policies that enablethe policyholder to receive the benefits before death. Accelerated benefits are normally reserved for those that suffer from a terminal illness, have a long term high-cost illness, require permanent nursing home confinement or have a medically incapacitating condition. Some insurance companies differ on how much cash can be pulled out and how close to death the insured has to be in order to receive these benefits. Insurers offer anywhere from 25to 100 percentof the death benefit as an early payment.Accelerated benefits are also referred to as living benefits.",Choosing an insurance policy with an accelerated benefitsallows the policyholder to pay for their daily living in an effort to make it ascomfortable as possible while also allowing the holder to look after his or her family once they pass away. This type of benefit was originally started in the late 1980s in an attempt to alleviate the financial pressures of those that were diagnosed with AIDS.
6,Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB),An accelerated death benefit (ADB) is a benefit that can be attached to a life insurance policy that enables the policyholder to receive cash advances against the death benefit in the case of being diagnosed with a terminal illness. Many individuals who choose anaccelerated death benefit have less than one year to live and use the money for treatments and other costs needed to stay alive.,Choosing an insurance policy with an accelerated death benefit (ADB) allows the policyholder to pay for their daily living in an effort to make it ascomfortable as possible while also allowing the holder to look after his or her family once they pass away. This type of benefit was originally started in the late 1980s in an attempt to alleviate the financial pressures of those that were diagnosed with AIDS.
7,Accelerated Option,"An acceleratedoption in an insurance contract, usually in the form of a rider,allows for accelerated benefits or partial benefits sooner than they would otherwise be payable. Alternatively, in life insurance contracts, an accelerated option can refer to the option that allows the policy holder to apply the accumulated cash value to pay off the policy.","One form of an accelerated option is the accelerated death benefit rider in a whole life insurance policy. Accelerated benefits, also known as ""living benefits,"" are life insurance policy proceeds paid to the policyholder before he or she dies. The benefits may be provided in the policies themselves, but more often they are added by riders or attachments to new or existing policies."
8,Acceleration Life Insurance,"A type of policy that pays a portion (typically 25% or 50%) of the death benefits (the face amount of the policy, less any outstanding loans or fees) in case of a specified illness or medical emergency.  ","The accelerated death benefit provides funds necessary to pay for medical costs, to extend the life of the insured. Insurance companies pay the specified percentage of the death benefit in a lump sum.Upon death, the remainder of the insured's death benefit is paid to the beneficiary, just as under a traditional life insurance policy."
9,Accelerative Endowment,An accelerative endowment is anoption in a whole life insurance policy to use accumulated dividends to convert the policy into an endowment policy prior to its normal maturity date. An endowment policy provides for a lump sum payment to the insured after a certain period.,An accelerative endowment is a form of an accelerated option that allows policyholders to access the value of their life insurance policies prior to death.The main benefit of accelerative endowments is that they give policyholders the option to receive a lump sum of money before their death. This is different from other life insurance options that only provide benefits upon the death of the insured. The lump sum allows the insured to make more investments or later earn a fixed income through the purchase an annuity policy. Or the lump sum received can be invested any way a policyholderwants.
10,Accident And Sickness Insurance Act,"This is a Canadian government statute that defines the acceptable terms and conditions of  health insurance coverage and sets out guidelines to which these policies must conform. It is now known as the Uniform Accident and Sickness Insurance Act, which is the model law adopted by the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR). The model legislation has been enacted, with minor variations, by all Canadian provinces. ","In Canada's extremely competitive life and health insurance market, the enactment of national laws and the ability to establish uniform standards agreed-to by all the provincial governments was a feat of great magnitude. It serves as a model for other nations with decentralized standards and licensing requirements. "
11,Accident-Year Statistics,Accident-Year Statistics are used by insurance companies to gauge what percentage of the premiums received are being paid out in claims. They are a measure of the total losses against the total revenue (both deductibles and premiums).,"Accident year statistics are a useful tool with regards to setting the premiums on all types of insurancefor the following year. In watching the trends of the accident-year statistics, insurance companies are able to forecast what their losses are likely to be, and therefore, decide what premiums to charge in order to make a profit."
12,Accidental Death And Dismemberment Insurance (AD&D),"Accidental death and dismemberment insurance (AD&D) is usually a rider to a health insurance or life insurance policy. The rider covers the unintentional deathor dismembermentof the insured. Dismemberment includes the loss, of or the loss of use, of body parts or functions (e.g., limbs, speech, eyesight, or hearing). Because of coverage limitations, prospective buyers should carefully read the terms of the policy.",
13,Accidental Death Benefit,"The accidental death benefit ispayment due to the beneficiary of an accidental death insurance policy, which is often a clause orrider connected to a life insurance policy. The accidental death benefit is usually an amount paid in addition to the standard benefit payable if the insured died of natural causes.","Depending on the issuer of the policy, the accidental death benefit may extend up to a year after the initial accident occurred, so long as the accident led to the insured's death."
14,Accidental Means,"Accidental means is a condition for losses covered under an insurance policy that requires the loss to have been the result of an accident, rather than the result of a non-accident. As a condition, accidental means is designed to protect insurers from having to pay claims on events that were not accidents.","Insurers use the wordaccident to describe an event that happens unintentionally, and which is unexpected or unforeseen. Accidental means may involve acts that caused damage or harm, but which were themselves accidental. Both the injury and the event have to be considered accidents in order for a claim to be covered. Accidental means is a precise definition ofaccident, and is stricter than merely defining an accident as an unforeseen event."
15,Account Current,"The account current is a summary statement detailing the financial performance of an individual insurance agents business over a specified period. These statements form the basis for reconciliation of accounts between the insurer and the agent. The account current provides the basis of a paper trail as premiums paid by policyholders travel between insurance provider, agencies, and agents.","An account current lays out the financial components of an insurance agents business in detail. The statement is usually comprehensive in that it specifiespremium and claim performance at the individual policy level. The accounting also typically shows summary transaction information as a record of balances owed. These balances are due to either to the insurance agent or the insurer, depending on the balance of claims paid, the premiums which are writtenand those which are returned, and commissions."
16,Accountable Care Organizations,"Accountable Care Organizations are networks of healthcare providers who collaborate to provide improved and more cost-effective treatment to patients. These organizations were established under Medicare Shared Savings Program, a portion of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. These organizations were originally designed to support Medicare participants but have grown to include private payer networks as well.","Accountable care organizations (ACOs) were designed to share information, provide more cost-effective treatments services, and eliminate redundancies for patients in the Medicare system. ACOs are structured around a patients primary care physician (PCP), but should also include hospitals, pharmacies, specialists, and other service providers to achieve optimal efficiency. The ACO model was introduced through the Medicare Shared Savings Program, a component of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA mandates that an approved ACO manage the healthcare of a minimum 5,000 patients over a three-year period. ACOs are overseen by the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS)."
17,Accounts Receivable Insurance,Accounts receivable insurance protects a company against financial losses caused by damage to its accounts receivable records. This type of coverage is important because theloss of accounts receivable records may render afirmunable to collect money it is owed by customers.,"Accounts receivable insurance provides protection for a variety of situations involving a company's accounts receivable records. First, it will cover a firm for sums that can't be collected fromcustomers due torecords beingdamaged or destroyed by a covered peril. Accounts receivable coverage will also cover a policyholder for interest charges on a loanobtained to offset uncollected sums."
18,Accredited Advisor In Insurance - AAI,An Accredited Advisor in Insurance (AAI) is a credential earned by insurance professionals after a course of study and a series of examinations.,Accredited Advisor in Insurance is a professional designation earned by insurance producers who demonstrate superior knowledge of their field compared to average agents. Insurance professionals earn the title by passing a series of three tests administered by the Insurance Institute of America. The knowledge gained from the course of study required to pass these tests can aid insurance agents selling sophisticated products or dealing with unusually complex insurance situations.
19,Accumulated Value,"Accumulated value is the total amount an investment currently holds, including the capital invested and the interest (gain) it has earned to date. Accumulated value is important in the insurance field because it refers to the total acquired value of awhole (or universal)life insurancepolicy. It is calculated as the sum or total of the initial investment, plusinterest earned to date. Accumulated value is alsoreferred to as accumulated amount or cash value.","For insurance purposes, accumulatedvalue begins to buildwhen the policyholder of a whole (or universal) life insurance policy startspayinga monthly premium. An insurance company takes thosepremium payments and divides theminto two portions. The first portion covers the basic insurance policy costs. The second portion acts as a type of investment that accumulates cash value, which is placed in an internal account by the insurance company."
20,Accumulation Option ,"An accumulation option is a policy feature of permanent life insurance that reinvests dividends back into the policy, where it can earn interest.Some types of insurance pay dividends to their policyholders each year when the insurance company performs better than estimated.Accumulation options areone of several optionspolicyholders have for what to do withthedividends they receive. An accumulation option is also known as an""accumulation at interest dividendoption,"" ""accumulation at interest option"" or ""dividends on accumulation.""","Accumulation options are available to participating permanent life insurance policyholders. The interest earned is taxable to the policy owner annually. The total dividend balance is payable in addition to the face amount of the whole life policy as a death benefit, as well as, being included with the whole life policy guaranteed cash value upon the surrender of the policy."
21,Act Of God,"An act of God describes an event outside of human control or activity. It's usually a natural disaster, such as a flood or an earthquake. Insurance policies usually specify which particular acts of God they cover, if any.",The phraseact of God is not actually associated with any particular religion or belief system. Contractual languagereferring to acts of God are known as force majeure clauses.
22,Act-as-One Provision,An act-as-one provision is areinsurance contract provision requiringreinsurers that are party to a single contract to work together to choose a single arbitrator in the case of a dispute. An act-as-one provision is used when multiple reinsurance companies are involved in the same disputeand prevents a situation in which multiple arbitration panels are being used to represent different reinsurers.,"Act-as-one provisions streamline the settling of disputes by treating all reinsurers associated with the dispute as one, rather than involving many different arbitration panels in the proceedings. By forcing the reinsurers to work together, the process bypasses confusion. The dispute is thus between the reinsured and a group of reinsurers that are all treated as if they were part of a single reinsurance company."
23,Active Retention,"Active retention is the act of protecting against a loss by designating specific funds to pay for it. This is the opposite practice of passive retention, in whichno funds are set aside to cover an upcoming or estimated loss.","Active retention, also sometimes known as planned retention, is used to ensure the ability to cover smaller or expected losses. It is viewed as a form of self-insurance whereas the entity expected to experience the loss relies on their own funds to cover any occurrences. This practice can be used by those looking to avoid additional fees and costs associated with dealing with agencies, or for activities that may not qualify for traditional insurance."
24,Actual Authority,"Actual authority refers to specific powers, expressly conferred by a principal (often an insurance company) to an agent to act on the principal's behalf. This power may be broad, general power or it may be limited, special power. Specific powers are alsoknown as ""express authority.""","Actual authority arises where the principal's words or conduct rationally cause the agent to believe that he or she has been empowered to act. An agent receives actual authority either orally or in writing. Written authority is preferable, as verbal authority is somewhat difficult to verify. In a corporation, written express authority includes bylaws and resolutions from directors' meetings which grant the authorized person permission to carry out a specificact on behalf of the corporation.Ifan agent, operating under actual authority,enters into a contract with a third party, the contract will create contractual rights and liabilities between the principal and the third party."
25,Actual Cash Value,"Actual cash value is the amount equal to the replacement cost minus depreciation of a damaged or stolen property at the time of the loss. It is the actual value for which the property could be sold, which is always less than what it would cost to replace it.","Sometimes, insurance companies use actual cash value to determine the amount to be paid to a policyholder after loss or damage to the insured property. In the case of an automobile that is totaled in an accident, for example, the insurance company would typically pay the actual cash value of the vehicle after determining its replacement cost and subtracting factors such as depreciation and wear and tear. Under replacement-cost coverage, the insurer would pay the amount required to replace the covered item with a like-kind new one."
26,Actuarial Age,"Actuarial age is an individual's life expectancy based on calculations and statistical modeling. Actuaries use mathematical and statistical computations to predict a person's life expectancy, or his or her actuarial age, to assist insurance companies with pricing, forecasting and planning. For instance, knowing a person's actuarial age will help determine the most appropriate payments from an annuity.",A person's actuarial age is the age to which mathematical and statistical modeling indicate a person will live. The actuarial age reflects factors such as health and serious medical conditions. Actuaries assess risk for insurance companies and use computerized predictive modeling to project probable outcomes for a wide variety of circumstances.
27,Actuarial Assumption,"An actuarial assumption is an estimate of an uncertain variable input into a financial model, normally for the purposes of calculating premiums or benefits. For example, a common actuarial assumption relates to predicting a person's lifespan, given their age, gender, health conditions and other factors. Actuaries use large tables of statistical data which correlate the uncertain variable to a variety of key predictive variables. Given the values for the predictive variables, a sound actuarial assumption can be made for the uncertain variable.","Anactuarial assumptionestimates of an unknown value based on themethods of actuarial science. An actuarial assumption is made using statistical tools, such as thecorrelationof known values to possible outcomes for the unknown value. Typically, the preparation of an actuarial assumption requirescomplex mathematical and statistical techniques."
28,Actuarial Equity,"Actuarial equity is the calculation of an insurance premium based on crucial factors such as the applicant's age, gender, health, family history and the type of insurance coverage applied for. This is soinsurers can to treat applicants fairly according to their estimated risk levels.","In automobile insurance, for example, insurers use age as a rating factor in determining individual premiums. Thus, because young people tend to have less favorable driving records as a group, these individuals are required to pay out more in premiums, which normally include the expected value of losses. Also known as risk-based pricing."
29,Actuarial Life Table,"An actuarial life table is a table or spreadsheet that shows the probability of a person at a certain age dying before his or her next birthday.These statistics calculate the remaining life expectancy for people at different ages and the probability of surviving a particular year of age. Because men and women have differing mortality rates, an actuarial life table is computedseparately for men and women.An actuarial life table is also called mortality table, life table or actuarial table.","Insurance companies utilize actuarial life tables to help price products and project future insured events. Mathematically and statistically based actuarial life tables assist insurance companies by showing event probabilities, such as death, sickness and disability. An actuarial life table can also include factors to differentiate variable risks such as smoking, occupation, socio-economic status and even gambling and debt load. Computerized predictive modeling allows actuaries the ability to calculate for a wide variety of circumstances and probable outcomes."
30,Actuarial Rate,"Actuarial rate is an estimate of the expected value of future loss. Usually, the future loss experience is predicted on the basis of historical loss experience and the consideration of the risk involved. Accurate actuarial rates help protect insurance companies against the risk of severe underwriting losses that could lead to insolvency.","Generally, during the rate review, it is first determined whether the actuarial rates need to be adjusted. A projected loss experience gives the insurance companies the ability to determine the minimum premium required to cover expected losses."
31,Actuarial Risk,"Actuarialrisks are the risks that the assumptions that actuaries implement into a model to price a specific insurance policy may turn out wrong or somewhat inaccurate.Possible assumptions include the frequency of losses, severity of losses and the correlation of losses between contracts. Actuarial risk is also known as ""insurance risk.""",The level of actuarial risk is directly proportional to the reliability ofassumptions implemented in pricing models used by insurance companies to set premiums.
32,Actuarial Science ,"Actuarial science is adiscipline that assesses financial risks in the insurance and finance fields, using mathematical and statistical methods. Actuarial science appliesthe mathematics of probability and statistics to define, analyze and solve the financial implications of uncertain future events. Traditional actuarial science largely revolves around the analysis of mortality and the production of life tables, and the application of compound interest.","Actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial,life insurance, and annuities.Actuarial science spansseveralinterrelated subjects, includingmathematics,probability theory,statistics,finance,economicsandcomputer science. Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. In the last 30 years, the science has undergone revolutionary changesdue to the proliferation of high speed computers and the union ofstochasticactuarial models with modern financial theory."
33,Actuarial Service,"Actuarial service is one way corporations determine, assess and plan for the financial impact of risk. Actuaries use mathematical and statistical models to evaluate risk in the insurance and finance industries. In addition to mathematical and statistical methods, actuaries call upon other fields including probability, finance, economics and computer programming to create actuarial models. Actuarial science is used to evaluate and predict future payouts for insurance and other financial industries such as the pension industry.","Actuarial services include the analysis of rates of disability, morbidity, mortality, retirement, survivorship and other contingencies. By using mathematical and statistical modeling, actuaries are able to provide estimates regarding particular events, such as the life span of a life insurance applicant, or the likelihood of a catastrophic, weather-related event for a property and casualty insurance firm. Actuarial services forecast risk and uncertainty and help firms plan for future probabilities and possibilities."
34,Actuarial Value,"Actuarial value is thepercentage of total average costs for covered benefits that will be paid by a health insurance plan. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the U.S. health reform enacted March 23, 2010, health plans available on the Health Insurance Marketplace are divided into fourmetallic tier levels – Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum – based on the actuarial values. Bronze plans, for example, pay on average 60% of the medical costs of covered benefits. Silver plans pay 70 percent, Gold plans pay 80 percentand Platinum plans pay 90 percent.","By default, the actuarial value represents the corresponding percentage that will be paid by the individual policy holders. For example, if a Bronze plan pays (on average) 60 percentof covered medical expenses, Bronze policy holders would be responsible for (on average) the remaining 40 percentof the expenses excluding premiums, which are not included as part of the calculation."
35,Actuary,"An actuary is a professional whoassesses and manages the risks of financial investments, insurance policies and other potentially risky ventures.",
36,Add To Cash Value Option,"The add to cash value option is a common benefit option on life insurance policies wherein the policy owner allows the dividends from the policy to be used for the purposeof accumulating cash value, which adds to the overall death benefit.","The add to cash value option allows policyholders, upon the death of the insured, to increase thedeath benefitfor their beneficiaries based upon the cash value amount accrued within the policy."
37,Add-On No-Fault Laws,"Add-on no fault laws are a type of state statute that allow policyholders to bring litigation against other drivers, even if they have personal injury protection (PIP) coverage through their auto insurance policy.","Several states have add-on no-fault laws These laws are less restrictive on the issue of torts than laws only allowing for pure no-fault insurance. States with add-on no fault insurance laws include Arkansas, Delaware, Washington D.C., Maryland, New Hampshire and Oregon."
38,Addendum,"An attachment to a contract is an addendum. Addendums are useful to changeterms or conditions ofmany types of contracts.Its function is to modify, clarify, or nullify a portion of the original documents.","An addendum may include any written itemaddedto an existing piece of writing. The addition often applies to supplemental documentation to change the initial agreement forming the original contract. In that context,The addition may also serve a purely informational purpose, such as a supplement to a book or documents that demonstrate a provision of the contract. In these cases, the information may also contain drawings or diagrams that clarify the details of an agreement."
39,Additional Death Benefit,Additional death benefit is a term that refers to an amount paid to a beneficiary of a life insurance contract that is separate from the original death benefit.,"Additional death benefit is an extra layer of payment in the event that a predefined situation occurs. For example, if an individual has a life insurance policy worth $1 million, their beneficiary receives the $1 million dollars, but this beneficiary may qualify for additional money depending on the circumstances of the policyholders death as outlined in the life insurance contract. Additional death benefits can occur for a variety of reasons, and in some policies beneficiaries can receive an extra $1 million if the policyholder dies within a certain age range."
40,Additional Expense Coverage,"Additional expense coverage is coverage that provides funds for expenses above what the policyholder was paying before a claim was made. It is provided to a policyholder if certain criteria are met, and may have a maximum time period over which benefits can be received and a policy limit of the amount of coverage that will be provided.","In order for an expense to be considered for repayment by an insurer under a homeowners policy it must meet a certain number of qualifications. The expense must be considered necessary, must be incurred by the policyholder, must be for the purpose of continuing a normal standard of living, and must be caused by the insurable event occurring. For example, in the case of a homeowner who has his property damaged in a fire, additional expense coverage may cover expenses related to extra costs for food, laundry, and transportation."
41,Additional Insured,"Additional insured is a type of status associated with general liability insurance policies that provides coverage to other individuals/groups that were not initially named. With an additional insuredendorsement, the additional insured will then be protected under the named insurer's policy and can file a claim in the event that they are sued.","As an example of how theadditional insured concept works, a business may ask a contractor to add them as an additional insured in their general liability policy. This is to protect the business in the event oflegal claims that may arise as a direct result of the contractor's work or presence."
42,Additional Living Expense (ALE) Insurance,"Additional living expense (ALE)insurance refers to coverage under a homeowner's, condominium owner's or renter's insurance policy that covers the additional costs of living that are incurred by the policyholder should they be temporarily displaced from their place of residence. Such coverage is usually amounts toabout 10to 20 percentof the insurance that covers the dwelling.","Additional living expense insurance can cover things like the increase in a monthly food bill due to having to eatout at restaurants or even the loss of income that might be incurred if the insured person were renting out part of their dwellingto a tenant. Essentially, the insurance is intended to cover the insured person for the extra expenses he or she may incur due to being temporarily displaced from their home, such aswith afire or flood."
43,Adequacy Of Coverage,"The adequacy of coverage concerns how well your insurance policies protect your assets against unforeseen losses. In order to evaluate the adequacy of your insurance coverage, you should consider many different loss scenarios and judge whether your insurance deductibles and limits are sufficient.","The concept of adequacy of coverage is subjective, and largely depends on one's propensity to take on risk rather than pay higher insurance premiums. One's ability to absorb losses should also be considered, as a person with very few liquid assets will be unable to pay large deductibles or sustain other uninsured losses. Alternatively, those with substantial assets may wish to obtain higher limits to their coverage to avoid losing the wealth built up over many years."
44,Adhesion Contract,"In an adhesioncontract,one party has substantially more power than the other in creating the contract. For a contract of adhesion to exist, the offeror must supply a customer with standard terms and conditions that are identical to those offered to other customers. Those terms and conditions are not negotiable.","An example of an adhesion contract is an insurance contract. In an insurance contract, the company and its agent has the power to draft the contract, while the potential policyholder only has the right of refusal; he or she cannot counter the offeror create a new contract to whichthe insurer canagree.Before signing an adhesion contract, it is imperative toread it over carefully, as all the information and rules have been written by the other party."
45,Adjustable Feature,An adjustable feature is contract language that allows adjustments to be made to the premium and commission features of a reinsurance treaty. An adjustable feature may include such features as sliding scale commissions and adjustable ratings. The formulas used by contract parties to adjust premiums and commissions are agreed to in the original contract. Adjustable features are found in most pro rate reinsurance treaties.,"Adjustable features are considered a risk that reinsurance companies have to account for, and which reinsurers wish to limit as much as possible. It alters the timing and amount of cash flows between the reinsured, which cedes premiums, and the reinsurer, which assumes risk. While reinsurance companies may prefer contracts without adjustable features, the number of contracts that are considered straightforward reinsurance contracts tend to be small."
46,Adjustable Life Insurance,"Adjustable life insurance is a term and whole life hybrid insurance plan that allows policyholders the option to adjust policy features. These policies allow policyholders the ability to adjust the period of protection, face amount, premiums, and length of the premium payment period. These policies also incorporate an interest-bearing savings component or cash value account.",
47,Adjustable Premium,An adjustable premium is a type of insurance policy with a monthly payment that can fluctuate over time.,"An adjustable premium can also be known as a variable premium in the insurance market. Things like higher than expected maintenance costs on the policy may cause the rates to increase. On the other hand, increased investment returns from the insurance company could lessen the monthly outlay. Most of the time consumers seek these types of policies out when they are looking for flexibility in their monthly payment or when they expect their lifestyle situation to change over time and would like to have their payments change with it."
48,Adjusted Earnings,"Adjusted earnings are the sum of earnings and increases in loss reserves, new business, deficiency reserves, deferred tax liabilities and capital gainsfor an insurance company from the previous time period to the current time period. Adjusted earnings providea measurement of how current performance compares with performance in previous years.","Calculating adjusted earnings can varyaccording to the type of insurance being sold. Because outside investors do not have access to the same amount of information as internal employees, it can be difficult to ascertain an insurers adjusted earnings. Approaches may vary according to how they examine expenses and premiums.A property and casualty insurance company, for example, will calculateadjusted earnings by taking the sum of its net income, catastrophe reservesand reserves for price changes, thensubtracting gains or losses from investment activities. A life insurance company will subtract capital transactions, such as increases in capital, from increases in premiums written."
49,Adjusted Net Worth,"Adjusted net worth calculates the value ofan insurance company, using capital values, surplus valuesand an estimated value for business on the company's books. Itstarts with the estimated value for business and addsunrealized capital gains, the capital surplus and the voluntary reserves.","As the adjusted net worth represents a measure of value of an insurance company, it is a useful way to compare the company's relative value to other insurance companies. The word ""adjusted"" in the phrase is a clue that it is meant to reflect economic value which can be compared between multiple firms. It is common to standardize values that are generated from the financial statements to use in analyzing an industry. This allows a particular company's relative value to be statistically compared across theindustry."
50,Adjusted Premium,"An adjusted premium is the premium of a life insurance policy that is adjusted by amortizing the costs associated with acquiring the insurance policy. The adjusted premium is equal to the net-level premium plus an adjustment, to reflect the cost associated with the first year initial acquisition expenses.The adjustment to the net-level premium is an amortization of the expenses associated with establishing the initial insurance policy. The net-level premium is the total cost of the policy (from inception to payout), divided by the number of years the policy is expected to be in force. This term is specific to life insurance companies. ","The adjusted premium is important for life insurance companies to calculate, as it is the premium used to figure the minimum cash surrender value (CSV). All life insurance policies are required to calculate a CSV due to the Nonforfeiture Provision, which means that the life insurance policy always has a value, even when the policy holder chooses not to use it for its original purpose (payout upon death).The CSV is the value that could be received by terminating the policy and choosing to ""cash-out."" The insured is entitled to other choices under the provision, including taking a loan against the policy using the cash value as collateral. "
51,Adjusted Premium Method,"The adjusted premium method is a formula that insurance carriers use to calculate the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy. In a broad sense, this method is based on the total value of premiums paid up to the surrender date, net of any expenses or fees that have accumulated to that point.","The adjusted premium method is the most commonly used formula for calculating the cash surrender value (CSV) of a life insurance policy. Insurance carriers use this formula to determine the payout due to a policyholder in the event that they choose to cancel the policy prior to the end of its term, if applicable. The CSV of a policy is drawn from the savings portion of that policy, as opposed to the portion that is set aside for payment of death benefits. The CSV should not be confused with the policys face value, which is another term for the death benefit."
52,Adjusted Underwriting Profit,Adjusted underwriting profit is the profitthat an insurance company earns after paying out insurance claimsand expenses. Insurance companies earn revenue by underwritingnew insurance policiesand earning income on their financial investments. Subtracted from this revenue are expenses associated with running the business and any claims that are made by insurance policyholders. The remainder is the adjusted underwriting profit. This term is specific to the insurance industry.,"The adjusted underwriting profit is a measure of success for an insurance company. It is important for an insurancecompany to successfully manage their financial investments so they can pay out on the insurance policies they have sold. If they practice prudent underwriting procedures and responsible asset-liability management (ALM), they should be able to generate a gain. If they underwrite policies they shouldn't or fail to match their assetsto their future insurance policy liabilities, they will not be as profitable."
53,Adjuster,An adjuster is an insurance claims agent. A claims adjuster is charged with evaluating an insurance claim to determine the insurance company's liability under the terms of an owner's policy.,"There are different types of adjusters. They may represent the insurance company, they may be hired by the claimant (public adjusters) or they may be independent. The two types of claims most frequently investigated are property claims and liability claims."
54,Adjustment Income,"Adjustment income is income paid to the dependent(s) of a primary wage earner in the event that the primary wage earner passes away. These funds, usually provided through life insurance policies, represent income above and beyond the death benefit and are intended to provide financial support while the beneficiary adjusts to becoming self-sufficient.","Adjustment income is a benefit that provides financial assistance to a beneficiary once the primary wage earner has passed away. A common example of adjustment income would be funds provided to a widow upon the death of her spouse. This income is intended to help cover expenses until the beneficiary is self-sufficient, allowing an individual the necessary time to recover emotionally and to receive career counseling and job training, if necessary."
55,Adjustment Provision,"Adjustment Provision is a provision or provisions in a life insurance policy that allows the it to be changed in one or more ways. This may involve increases or decreases to either the policy's premium or face amount, changes to the length of protection or period of premium payments.","Adjustable life insurance policies carry higher premiums but allow the policy holder to make adjustments as his or her needs change. Insurers and plans differ regarding the frequency, amount and degree of changes allowed. Increases to a policy's face amount usually require that the policy holder re-prove his/her insurability."
56,Administrative Charge,"An administrative charge is a fee charged by an insurer or other agency responsible for administering a group employee benefit plan to cover expenses related to record keeping and/or other administrative costs. It is also referred to an an ""administrative fee.""","Altering aninsurance policy mid-term canresult in costly administrative charges.Consider a scenario in whichyouve compared prices and found a great insurancedeal.You might think finding that great rate is all you mustdoto geta great insurancebargain.However, sometimes the unforeseen and inevitable happen –you change jobs, you move to a new house, you upgrade your car or you sell it.In such situations, youll need to let your insurer know to avoid invalidating your policy. Unfortunately, these types of situations can result in unanticipated administrative charges."
57,Administrative Services Only - ASO,"Administrative Services Only (ASO) is an arrangement in which an organization funds its own employee benefit plan such as a health plan but hires an outside firm to perform specific administrative services. For example, an organization may hire an insurance company to evaluate and process claims under its employee health plan, while maintaining the responsibility to pay the claims itself.","ASO arrangements are common in the Canadian health plan space. Plan specifics vary depending on the agreement a company establishes with insurance companies and third-party administrators (TPA). But in these arrangements, the insurance company provides little to no degree of insurance protection as it would through a fully-insured plan sold to the employer. In this sense, an ASO plan is a type of self-insured plan or self-funded plan. The employer takes full responsibility for claims made to the plan. For this reason, many employers running ASO plans also establish stop-loss arrangements in which the insurance company takes responsibility for paying claims that exceed a certain level such as $10,000 per insured person in exchange for a premium."
58,Admission Board,"An admissions board comprises representatives of a particular stock exchange who determine whether a company will be allowed to list its shares on that exchange. An exchange's admission board establishes the exchange's listing requirements, ensures that listed stocks comply with those requirements and makes decisions about when a stock should be delisted.","An admission board's requirements for listed companies may include: the submission of two to three previous years' worth of financial statements, the issuance of a prospectus and the meeting or exceeding of minimum requirements for total market value, number of shares outstanding and share price. The board's guidelines and decisions must comply with securities regulations established by the government. An exchange's admission board generally consists of high-level executives such as CEOs, CFOs, directors, vice presidents and partners from a variety of major companies."
59,Admitted Company,"Admitted Company is an insurance company that is domiciled in one state but is admitted by another state to transact insurance business. Because insurance licenses are governed by the states, an insurance company must be licensed by each state where it intends to conduct business, and must comply with each state's insurance codes, including financial requirements.","An insurance company is considered a ""foreign,"" ""alien"" or ""non-resident"" company except in the state in which its primary offices are domiciled. In addition, any person selling insurance of an admitted company must be licensed in that particular state."
60,Admitted Insurance,"Admitted insurance is insurance purchased from an insurance company that has been formally admitted or licensed to operate by the state insurance agency where the company operates.Admitted insurance companies aresubject to variousstate laws that governorganization, capitalization, policy forms, rate approvalsand claims handling, whereas non-admitted insurance companies are not subject to these regulations.","Status as an admitted insurance company mandates compliancewith all state insurance regulations, which are established and maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners(NAIC)."
61,Advance Directive,"An advance directive, sometimes calledaliving will, is a document expressing a person's wishes about critical care when they are unable to decide for themselves. With an advance directive, individuals have the power to make future decisions about their own critical care without outside influence. A person who wishes or does not wish to be placed on life support can create an advance directive that hospital staff will follow should the person become incapacitated.","An advance directive is a living will documenting ones wishes for end-of-life medical treatment. The document instructs whether dialysis, breathing machines or tube feeding are desired, whether to resuscitate and whether to donate organs and tissue at the end of one's life. Planning ahead provides the medical care a person desires and avoids unnecessary suffering, disagreements and decision-making burdens during times of crisis. Two physicians must certify the person is terminally ill, seriously injured, in a coma, in the late stages of dementiaor permanently unconscious and unable to make medical decisions before the living will is enacted."
62,Advance Loss Of Profit (ALOP) Insurance,Advanceloss of profit (ALOP)insuranceprovides coverage for financial losses due to delays in construction and infrastructure projects. ALOPwill alsoprovidea payoutifcompaniesface higher costs or lost profits when a project takes longer than expected to complete. ALOP is also called delayed completion coverage or delay instart-up(DSU) insurance.,"Large construction projectspurchase advanceloss of profit insurance because theyface a number of risks that could result in delayed project completion. A harsh winter, for example,may delay the start of a project and, thus,the completion date, or maybe theconstructionsite soil ismoreunstablethan engineers originally estimated. The possible causes for delays are numerous and often unexpected."
63,Advance Premium,"An advance premium is an initial premium paid to bind an insurance policy for a given period of time.The most commonly known use of the term ""advance premium,""is with respect to fluctuating insurance payments, such as payroll-based policies, where the actual amount due is not known until after the fact.","Advance premium can also refer to pre-paid premiums, where the policyholder makes a premium payment before it is due."
64,Advance Premium Mutual,An advance premium mutual insurance company that operates as an advance premium insurer rather than an assessment insurer.These insurers assess premiums in advance and the premiumsdo not change for a stated period of time. An assessment insurer assesses policyholders their premiums based on actual loss and expense experience of the company.,"Advance premium insurers and assessment insurers are specifically identified in various state laws and have different statutory requirements in the operation of their businesses. Mutual companies are also sometimes referred to as cooperatives.A mutualinsurance companyis owned by policyholders. The sole purpose of a mutual insurance company is to provideinsurance coveragefor its members and policyholders, and its members are given the right to select management. Federal law, rather than state law, determines whether an insurer can be classified as a mutual insurance company."
65,Advanced Diploma In Insurance,An Advanced Diploma in Insurance is a qualification earned byinsuranceindustry professionalspredominately located in the United Kingdom.,The Advanced Diploma in Insurance is granted by the Chartered Insurance Institute (CII). It was formerly titled The Associateship of the Chartered Insurance Institute (ACII).
66,Advanced Life Underwriting,Advanced life underwriting is a term for the most complex forms of life insurance underwriting. It typically involves the creation of policies for wealthy individuals with an unusual variety of assets and tax consequences or businesses insuring a large number of employees in a wide range of life situations.,"Advanced life underwriting describes the underwriting process that is necessary for individuals with complex financial profiles and businesses seeking to insure groups of such employees. It does not describe any particular certification, but underwriters involved in this portion of the insurance industry have formed a trade association, the Association of Advanced Life Underwriters."
67,Adverse Selection,"Adverse selection refers generallyto a situation where sellers have information that buyers do not have, or vice versa, about some aspect of product quality. In the case of insurance, adverse selection is the tendency of those in dangerous jobs or high-risk lifestyles to get life insurance. To fight adverse selection, insurance companies reduce exposure to large claims by limiting coverage or raising premiums.","Adverse selection occurs when one party in a negotiation has relevant information the other party lacks. The asymmetry of information often leads to making bad decisions, such as doing more business with less-profitable or riskier market segments."
68,Advertising Injury Coverage,"Advertising injury coverage is a component of commercial general liability insurance that protects the policyholder against claims of stolen ideas, invasion of privacy, libel, slander and copyright infringement related to advertising. Advertising injury coverage is a type of personal injury insurance, as opposed to physical injury insurance, and may also be called personal and advertising injury coverage.","Advertising injury coverage protects a business from claims of offenses allegedly committed in the course of advertising its goods, products or services. For example, suppose a team of disgruntled lawyers leaves the law firm they were employed by and decides to start their own firm. The new firm takes out a billboard, and the billboard uses font and color for its text that are nearly identical to those of the lawyers former employer. The former employer sues the disgruntled lawyers for advertising injury and demands that the billboard be taken down within 48 hours."
69,Advisory Endorsement,"Advisory endorsements are adjustments to the provisions used to create an insurance policy, and which are created by a ratings bureau for distribution to the bureaus member insurers. An advisory endorsement is not filed with a state insurance commission, and is instead provided to member insurers to file on their own.","Advisory endorsements serve an important purpose in the policy underwriting process. They can provide clarification as to what type of risks are covered or not covered, can be used to include other parties in the policy, or can provide other important information such as the geographic areas in which coverage applies. The advisory endorsement is used to modify the forms that the policy applicant must fill out, which is then included in the models that the insurer uses when determining the risk associated with providing coverage."
70,Aftermarket Parts,"Aftermarket parts are replacement parts that are not made by the original equipment manufacturer. Aftermarket parts are used to replace damaged parts in automobiles and other equipment, but their use may alter the coverage of an insured item. They are similar to generic pharmaceuticals in that they are cheaper than brand name medication, but are likely to have similar effectiveness.","Repairing a damaged vehicle can be expensive, and motorists may request aftermarket parts to be used whenever possible because they tend to be less expensive than parts made by anoriginal equipment manufacturer (OEM). Depending on the language of the auto policy, allowing the repair shop to use aftermarket parts instead of OEM parts may allow the insurer to alter the policys coverage going forward.In other words, insurance companies like aftermarket parts as much as the budget-conscious consumer does because they dont necessarily have to insure them."
71,Against All Risks - AAR,"Against all risks is an insurance policy that provides coverage against all types of loss or damage. Exclusions can still be included in an against all risks policy, but the insured will be covered against any risks that are not specifically named.","An against all risks insurance policy is the opposite of a named peril policy, which protects against specific lossesnamed in the policy. An example of a named peril policy would be a flood insurance policy, which specifically insures against damages incurred by flood waters."
72,Agency Plant,Agency Plant is the amount of presence that an insurance company has in a market. Agency plant includes both insurance agents that work for the insurer as well as independent agents that can sell the insurers policies. It can also refer to other personnel that an insurer may use to market its policies.,"Insurance companies make money by underwriting new insurance policies, which requires the company to undertake marketing efforts in order to create brand awareness. This may include advertisements placed in newspapers, appearing in television and radio commercials, as well as Internet campaigns. The goal of these efforts is to let individuals and businesses know what types of insurance policies the insurer offers, as well as to create the perception that the insurer is trustworthy."
73,Aggregate Deductible,"Aggregate deductible is thelimit deductible a policyholder wouldbe required to pay on claims during a given period of time. Aggregate deductibles are most likely to be features of product liability policies, or policies that may result in a large number of claims during a certain time period.","The draw of an aggregate deductible policy feature is that it puts a cap on the amount the insured has to pay.Manufacturers purchase product liability insurance in order to protect themselves from claims resulting from damages caused by their products. It is especially valuable for products that can cause significant damages if not manufactured correctly, such as medicines and automobiles, and with products that are sold in high volumes, such as toys."
74,Aggregate Excess Insurance,"An aggregateexcess insurancepolicylimits the amount that a policyholder has to pay out over a specific time period. It is designed to protect policyholders that experience an unusually high level of claims that areconsidered unexpected. Aggregate excess insurance provides payment for total losses that occur over a period of time, and is not limited to a per occurrence basis.",Also called stop-loss insurance.
75,Aggregate Extension Clause (AEC),"An aggregate extension clause (AEC) is a reinsurance contract clause that combines separate accidents or occurrences into an aggregate loss amount. An aggregate extension clause, or AEC, is used more than loss reinsurance treaties.",Insurance companies use reinsurance treaties to protect themselves from potential losses from underwritten insurance contracts. Businesses use reinsurance treaties to protect themselves from liability claims. The underwritten policies are the underlying policiesin the reinsurance treaty. A specific type of reinsurance treaty called an excess of loss reinsurance treatyprotects against the possibility that an insurer will experience severe losses.
76,Aggregate Limit,The aggregate limit is the maximum amount an insurer will pay for covered losses during a policy period. The annual aggregate limit is the total amount an insurer will pay in a given single year.,"For example, if your annual aggregate limit is $20 million, and you have claims totaling $25 million in a policy period, your insurance company will only pay up to the $20 million limit."
77,Aggregate Limit Of Liability,The aggregate limit of liability is the mostan insurer is obligated to pay to an insured party during a specified period. The aggregate limit of liability is spelled out in the insurance contract and caps the amount of covered losses for which an insurer will pay. These limits are part of commercial and professional general liability insurance policies.,"Insurance policies limit not only how much they will pay for a single incident, but theaggregate limit of liabilityis the limit forthe entire policy term, which is typically one year. If the policyholder files enough claims to reach the aggregate limit, he or she is effectively uninsured."
78,Aggregate Limits Reinstatement,"Aggregate Limits Reinstatement is an insurance policy clause that allows the policy limits to be returned to their maximum amount during the policys extended reporting period. These reinstatements are used when the original limits of the policy have been impacted by claims paid, or by any other impairment that reduces the limit.","Companies that purchase insurance hope that they are not subject to an insurance claim, especially if the losses associated with that claim exceed the limits outlined in the policy contract. They must choose the coverage limits before the contract is finalized, which can be difficult because estimating the costs associated with potential risks depends on a lot of factors. If claims are made against the policy its limits will be eroded, ultimately leading to the potential of additional claims exceeding the limit entirely. The limit may also be reached through a single, substantial claim."
79,Aggregate Mortality Table,"Aggregate mortality table is data on the death rate of everyone who has purchased life insurance, without categorization based on age or time of purchase. This calculation includes combined statistics of mortality tables.","In order to price insurance products and ensure the solvency of insurance companies through adequate reserves, actuaries must develop projections of future insured events that will lead to a payout(such as death, sickness, disability, etc.). To do this, actuaries develop mathematical models of the frequency and timing of the events."
80,Aggregate Product Liability Limit      ,The aggregate product liability limit is the maximum payout an insurance company will make during the life or term of an insurance product.,"The aggregate product liability limit is a set dollar amount on a property or liability policy which an insurance company will not be required to pay above. The amount remains unchanged, no matter how many claims are made per period, as long as neither the dollar amount nor time period have been exceeded."
81,Aggregate Stop-Loss Insurance,"Aggregate stop-loss insurance is a policy designed to limit claim coverage (losses) to a specific amount. This type of coverage is to ensure that catastrophic claims (specific stop-loss) or numerous claims (aggregate stop-loss), do not upset the financial reserves of a self-funded plan. Aggregate stop-loss protects the employer against higher-than-expected claims. If total claims exceed the aggregate limit, the stop-loss insurance carrier reimburses the employer.","Aggregate stop-loss insurance is held forself-funded insurance plans in which anemployer assumes the financial risk for providing healthcare benefits to its employees. In practical terms, self-funded employers pay for each claim as it is presented instead of paying a fixed premium to an insurance carrier for a fully insured plan. Stop-loss insurance is similar to purchasing high-deductible insurance. The employer remains responsible for claims expenses under the deductible amount."
82,Aggregate Stop-Loss Reinsurance,"In aggregate stop-loss reinsurance, losses over a specific amount are covered solely by the reinsurer and not by the ceding company.Aggregate stop-loss reinsurance caps the aggregate amount of losses for whicha ceding company is responsible. This capiscalled the attachment point, and itonly applieswhen the value of claims occurrences reaches the attachment point.","Aggregate stop-loss reinsurance contracts indemnify the reinsured for losses over a specific amount (called the attachment point) to the reinsurer. When an insurance company underwrites a new policy, itacceptsthe risk that claims may be filed by a policyholder, in exchange for a premium. State regulators limit the amount of risk that an insurer can take onand require insurance companies to set aside a loss reserve to cover potential claims. One way that insurers can reduce their overall risk is to work with reinsurers. In exchange for a fee, reinsurers will accept the risk ceded to them by the insurer."
83,Agreed Amount Clause,"The agreed amount clause is a property insuranceprovision through which the insurer agrees to waive the coinsurancerequirement. Insurers will require a statement of property values, signed by the policyholder, as a condition for activating or including an agreed value provision in a policy. The arrangement is available forcommercial and other properties.",Other names include the agreed value optional endorsementand waiver of coinsurance clause.
84,Air Cargo Insurance,"Air cargo insurance is a type of policy that protects a buyer or seller of goods being transported through the air. Itreimburses the insured for items that are damaged, destroyed or lost. Some insurance companies offer cargo insurance directly, as do severalfreight forwarders and trade-service intermediaries. The amount of coverage and deductible required for air cargo insurance varies based on the goods, as well as the individual provider.","While individuals sometimes buy air cargo insurance, far more often companies buy it toship their inventory to customers and distributors, both in the U.S. and around the world. Some large companies, in fact, may have one or more employees that deal solely with air-cargo and other freight-insurance claims"
85,Aircraft Insurance,"Aircraft insurance that provides liability and property coverage for aircraft. Aircraft insurance, also called aviation insurance, can be purchased for a number of different types of aircraft, including standard, experimental, and vintage aircraft, as well as seaplanes.","Aircraft insurance is necessary because claims or suits that arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of aircraft are generally excluded under the standard commercial general liability (CGL) forms."
86,Aleatory Contract,"In an aleatorycontract type,the parties involved do not have to perform a particular action until a specific event occurs. Events are those which cannot be controlled by either party, such as natural disasters and death. Aleatory contracts are commonly used in insurance policies. The insurer does not have to pay the insured until an event, such as a fire, results in property loss.","Aleatory contracts are historically related to gamblingand appeared in Roman law as contracts related to chance events. Ininsurance, an aleatory contract refers to an insurance arrangement in whichthe payouts to the insured are unbalanced. Until the insurance policy results in a payout, the insured pays premiums without receiving anything in return besides coverage. When the payouts do occur, they can far outweigh the sum of premiums paid to the insurer. If the event does not occur, the promise outlined in the contractwill not be performed."
87,Alien Insurer,"An alien insurer is an insurance provider offering coverage in a country other than the company's home country. Tthe relationship between the country of incorporated and the location where it sells a given policy defines if an insurer is alien. When the policy sells in a country other than the domiciled country, the provider is an alien.","Alien insurers may market to individuals or business who would find it too costly or difficult to purchase insurance from a domestic provider. A company based in Switzerland would be considered a domestic insurer of a policy purchased in Zurich. If a person in New York bought coverage from the same company, however, the insurance company would be considered an alien insurer."
88,All Risks,"All risks is a type of insurance coverage that automatically covers any risk that the contract does not explicitly omit. For example, if an all-risks homeowner's policy does not expressly exclude flood coverage, then the house will be covered in the event of flood damage.",This type of policy is found only in the property-casualty market.
89,All-In Coverage,"All-in coverage is a type of insurance coverage that applies to communally used features in residential multi-family buildings as well as the structures inside the individual units. All-in coverage, also called all inclusive coverage, is used for condominiums (or condos), a type of residential property in which some common elements, such as the entryway or light fixtures, are used by all residents of the building.","All-in coverage offers the broadest coverage when it comes to insuring a condominium building. It covers the structure of the building, from features that can be used by all the residents to the features only available in the individual units. This type of coverage is purchased by the condominium association, and is outlined in the associations rules and covenants."
90,All-Risks Coverage,"All-risks coverage providescoverage for any incident that an insurance policy doesnt specifically exclude. All-risks coverage, also called all-perils coverage, offers much broader protection than named risks coverage, which only covers incidents the policy specifically includes.However, the wordingall-risks coverage is somewhat misleading, because any insurance policy contains numerous exclusions. As a result, insurance policies tend to avoid this language. Insurers today will use terms likespecial perils coverage to describe what they used to callall-risks coverage. This type of coverage makes it the insurers responsibility to prove that the claim is not covered rather than the insureds responsibility to prove that the claim is covered.","Insurance providers generally offer two types of property coverage for homeowners and businesses –named perilsand all-risks coverage.A policy withall-risks coverage will not actually cover any type of loss. Insurance policies are typicallydesigned to cover specific situations and will list many incidents that arent covered. The most common types of perils excluded from all-risks include: earthquake, war, government seizure or destruction, wear and tear, infestation, pollution, nuclear hazard, market loss, etc. An individual or business thatrequires coverage for anyexcluded eventunder all risks may have the option to pay an additional premium, known as ariderorfloater, to have the peril included in the contract."
91,Alliance of American Insurers (AAI),"The Alliance of American Insurers(AAI) wascoalition consisting primarily of property-casualty insurance carriers. The Alliance of American Insurers was formed in order to provide political clout for the property-casualty insurance industry. It pursues various activities directed toward promoting its objectives to both politicians and the public. In 2004, the AAI andNational Association of Independent Insurers (NAII) merged to form anew organizationknown as the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI), which at the time represented over 40 percent of the property and casualty insurance marketplace.","Carrying on the workof both the Alliance of American Insurers andNAIImission, today'sPCI represents itself asthe property casualty industrys most effective and diverse trade association, representing1,000 member companies in decidedly""member-driven organization."""
92,Allied Healthcare Professional Liability Insurance,"Allied healthcare professional liability insurance provides coverage for medical professionals who are not physicians, such as nurses, physical therapists and dentists.","Allied healthcare professional liability insurance is designed to provide coverage for the many non-physician healthcare workers who provide a wide range of medical services. These include nurses, physicians assistants, midwives, dentists, physical therapists, occupational therapists and medical technicians. For a full list of healthcare professions covered, be sure to shop around."
93,Allied Lines,"Allied lines are any type of property-casualty insurance closely related to fire insurance coverage. Allied lines coverage is almost always taken out along with a standard fire insurance policy. Allied lines insurance can include coverage for such things as accounts receivable, data-processing equipment, water damage and vandalism.","The types of unforeseen losses covered by allied lines insurancecan causea flourishing business to suddenly find itself ina disastrous situation with major losses inproperty, inventory, machinery, tools and facilities, ultimately wiping out the capital and causing consequential losses. Monetary relief is essential in rebuilding andrestoring the damaged property. Allied linescoverage plays a vital role in safeguarding the financial interests of an enterprise."
94,Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE),"Allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE)are attributed to the processing of a specific insurance claim. ALAEare part of an insurers expense reserves. It is one of the largest expensesfor which an insurer has to set aside funds(along with contingent commissions).Allocated loss adjustment expenses, along with unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE), represent an insurer's estimate of the money it will pay out in claims andexpenses. Insurers set aside reserves for these expensestoensureclaims aren'tmade fraudulently andto process legitimate claims quickly.","Allocated loss adjustment expenses linkdirectly to the processing of a specific claim. Insurers –whichuse third parties to investigate the veracity of claims, to act as loss adjustersor to act as legal counsel for the insurer –may include this expense in its allocated loss adjustment expenses. Expenses associated with ULAE are more general, and may include overhead, investigationsand salaries. Insurers that use in-house employees for field adjustments would report that expense as an unallocated loss adjustment expense."
95,Allotment,An allotment commonly refers to the allocation of shares granted to a participating underwriting firm during an initial public offering (IPO). Remaining surpluses go to other firms that have won the bid for the right to sell the remaining IPO shares. There are more unique situations of allotment that arise when new shares are issued and allocated to either a new or existing shareholder.,"In business, allotment describes a systematic distribution of resources across different entities and over various time periods. In finance, the term typically relates to the distribution of shares during a public share issuance. Two or more financial institutions usually underwrite a public offering. Each underwriter receives a specific number of shares to sell."
96,Alphabet Broker,"Alphabet broker is slang terminology for the large, predominantly U.S.-based national insurance brokerage firms that are sometimes referred to by the initials that are derived from their legal names.

An alphabet broker is also sometimes referred to as an alphabet house.","Alphabet broker is a slang expression that is used in the insurance brokerage industry to represent a number of large old-school insurance brokers and consultants that are more commonly referred to by their initials rather than their full names. For example, it is likely than many more individuals are familiar with the name AIG than with the companys full name, American Insurance Group."
97,Alternate Employer Endorsement,An alternate employer endorsement extends workers' compensation coverage to other companies with whomthe primary insured may do business. Alternate employer endorsement lists other companies that are to be included in the policys coverage in the policys endorsement schedule.,"An alternate employer endorsement comes often comes into play when businesses use temporary employment agencies.Businesses may find themselves short-staffed on occasionand will seek out the services of such companies to fill the gaps. Workers employed through the temporary employment agency are covered under the workers' compensation policy that the agency has purchased. When the employee is hired out to an outside firm, the firm that hires the employee will seek an alternate employer endorsement in order to protect it from any lawsuits that the temporary employee may suffer."
98,Alternative Dispute Resolution,"Alternative dispute resolution is an insurance sense, a number of disparate processes used by insurance companies to resolve claim and contractual disputes. Insured clients who are denied a claim are offered this course of action as a form of recourse. It is employed to avoid expensive and time-consuming litigation and arbitration.","Alternative dispute resolution can take many forms. Examples of this type of resolution are non-binding arbitration and simple, direct negotiation between the insured and the carrier. In some cases, a neutral third party can be brought in to act as a mediator, if necessary."
99,Alternative Risk Financing Facilities,"Alternative Risk Financing Facilities is a type of private insurer that offers various types of coverage to both individuals and institutions. These insurers were originally created by groups of people or organizations that had a common need for a type of coverage that was not available commercially. In most cases, these same parties supplied the initial start-up capital to fund these facilities.","Alternative risk financing facilities can provide several different types of coverage, such as property-casualty insurance, worker's compensation, directors and officers liability insurance and medical malpractice coverage. A wide variety of types of insured employ these facilities for coverage, such as banks, medical professionals, manufacturers and public entities. The majority of the headquarters for these entities are located in Bermuda."
100,Alternative Risk Transfer (ART) Market,The alternative risk transfer (ART) marketis a portion of the insurance market that allows companies to purchase coverage and transfer risk without having to use traditional commercial insurance. The alternative risk transfer market includes risk retention groups (RRGs) as well as insurance pools and captive insurers.,"The alternative risk transfer market is broken into two primary segments: risk transfer through alternative products and risk transfer through alternative carriers. Transferring risk to alternative carriers entails finding organizations, such as captive insurers or pools, which are willing to take on some of the insurers risk for a fee. Transferring risk through alternative products entails the purchase of insurance policies or other financial products such as securities."
101,Ambulance Chaser,"Ambulance chaser is a derogatory term for attorneys, often personal injury lawyers, who aggressively solicit recently injured clients. These lawyers then tend to seek a beneficial settlement, including legal fees, from the opposing partys insurance company. Most lawyers would prefer such a settlement to facing the risks of litigation in a courtroom.","Ambulance chaser refers most directly to the aggressive and potentially unethical means through which some personal injury attorneys pursue clients. The term brings to mind the stereotypical image of a lawyer with a briefcase, running behind an emergency vehicle or snooping around an accident site."

103,American Agency System,"American agency system is a method of selling insurance policies in which independent insurance agents locate the best insurance policies for their customers and receive a commission for each insurance policy sold. The American agency system uses independent agents who can sell policies from a wide variety of companies, unlike captive agents, who can only sell one company's insurance products.","While many insurance customers these days are accustomed to calling different insurance companies and comparing quotes online, an independent agent, working in the manner known as the American agency system, does the work of researching different policies and companies on the customer's behalf. This may help a customer obtain a better deal."

106,American Experience Table,"A set of data, presented in table format, showing when Americans of various ages have died. This data allows life insurance companies to evaluate the likelihood that an individual will die at a certain age, which helps them to establish life insurance premiums. The American experience table uses a data set of 100,000 Americans who were alive at age 10 and showed how many of that group died each year. It was commonly used until the Commissioners Standard Ordinary (CSO) table became more common. ","The creation of accurate mortality tables is crucial to the financial viability of life insurance companies. As such, there are many different types of mortality tables. Some are considered more accurate or more appropriate than others depending on the situation. For example, one type of mortality table, the ultimate mortality table, excludes individuals who have recently purchased life insurance since these individuals had to pass medical exams to obtain the insurance and are known to be healthy. Other tables might account for the effects of gender weight, and tobacco use on expected mortality rates."
107,American Insurance Association (AIA),"The American Insurance Association (AIA), incorporated in 1866, has served as a leading property and casualty insurance trade organization. As of April 2016, the AIA represents more than 350 insurers that write more than $140 billion in premiums each year.

108,American Land Title Association (ALTA),"The American Land Title Association (ALTA) is a trade association representing the title insurance industry. Founded in 1907, ALTA also focuses on a property's abstract of title, which ties the history of the title to a particular piece of real estate.

110,Ancillary Benefits,"Ancillary benefits are asecondary type of health insurance coverage that covers miscellaneous medical expenses that are incurred during a stay at the hospital. Ancillary benefits can cover expenses such as ambulance transportation, blood, drugs and medical supplies like bandages. These benefits are usually layered on top of major medical coverage.","Ancillary benefits are offered to cover those expenses which many neglect to factor into the cost of healthcare. They are usually quoted as a multiplier of daily benefits provided by the hospital. For example, an ancillary policy may cover 20-times this daily benefit."
111,Animal Mortality Insurance,"Animal mortality insurance is a type of financial protection for businesses, governments or individuals that depend highly on one or more animals in their core operation. Farmers, zoos, aquariumsand professional horse stables use animal mortality insurance, for example.","Animal mortality insurance functions similarly to other types of insurance in that the insurance company will cover claims based on specified events. These might include storms, hypothermia, traffic accidents, contaminated food or water, or accidental shootings."
112,Anniversary Rating Date (ARD),"Anniversary Rating Date (ARD) is the day and month that an insurance policy came into effect, and, when reached the following year, marks the date at which the policy can be reexamined. The anniversary rating date, or ARD, determines how changes to the rules and rates of the policy are applied.","The premiums in some types of insurance policies, such as workers' compensation insurance, are governed by predefined rules, and may change over time. The anniversary rating date helps determine how these rules are applied. For example, workers compensation rates are often set by the state, and change at a specific date each year. This specific date is referred to as the effective date."
113,Annual Convention Blank,"The annual convention blank is an annual report that insurance carriers must file with the state insurance commissioner. This report will outline the carrier's current reserves, employees making over $40,000 a year, expenses and assets, among other things. The annual convention blank must be filed in order to show that a carrier is financially capable of doing business within the state.","Annual convention blanks must be filed with the commissioner of each state in which a carrier transacts business. Basically, this form allows the state to determine whether or not the insurance company has adequate reserves to pay out benefit payments as they come due."
114,Annual Dividend (Insurance),"In the insurance industry, an annual dividendis a yearly payment given by an insurance company to a policyholder. Annual dividends are most commonly distributed in conjunction with life insurance and disability income insurance policies. Insurance companies may pay their customers an annual dividend when the company's investment returns, experience (paid claims) and operating expenses in a given year are better than expected. Dividend amounts change each year and are not guaranteed.","Annual dividend calculations are based on the individual insurance policy's guaranteed cash value, the policy's annual premium, the company's actual mortality and expense costs and the dividend scale interest rate. Insurance companies need to make sure they earn enough in premiums each year to cover their expenses, reserves and contingencies, but they may choose to share a surplus with their customers. Policyholders who have borrowed against their policies may receive reduced annual dividends while the loan is outstanding."
115,Annual Premium Equivalent (APE),"An annual premium equivalent (APE) is a common sales measure calculation used by insurance companies in the United Kingdom, where the sales of a given insurance companyare estimated by taking the value of regular premiums, plus 10 percentof any new single premiums written for the fiscal year. If desired, thepremiums earned by an insurance companycan be extended to include all revenues of a given insurance company.","Annual premium equivalent (APE)is specifically usedwhensales contain both singlepremiumand regular premium business. This calculationis used by theinsurance industryto allow comparisonsof new business won in a given time period. Asingle-payment premiumactually spreads asaleover a longperiod of time. Bycontrast, arecurring premiuminvolves separate annual premiums. APE is used as a device to comparesingle premium payments to the recurring payment premiums. This helpsaccurately compare sales between policies with the two different types of premiums."
116,Annual Renewable Term (ART) Insurance,"A form of term life insurance that offers a guarantee of future insurability for a set period of years, although premiums are paid every year on the basis of a one-year contract. As such, the premiums will rise over time as the insured person ages. This type of insurance is designed for short-term insurance needs.","Annual renewable term insurance is less common than level term insurance, where premiums stay constant over the life of the contract. The longer an insured person uses annual renewable term insurance, the more costly it becomes.  ART insurance typically offers guaranteed re-insurability for a period of 10 to 30 years, depending on the age of the individual."
117,Anti-Concurrent Cause (ACC),An Anti-Concurrent Cause (ACC) is an insurance contract provision that removes coverage if a loss is caused by a combination of covered risks and excluded risks. This applies in situations in which events that ultimately create a loss occur at the same time.,"The anti-concurrent cause (ACC) provision came about in the 1980s in response to developments in insurance regulations. These regulations sought to resolve issues involving coverage. Concurrent causation exists when multiple perils occur, and policies were required to provide coverage even in scenarios in which an excluded peril was the primary cause of the loss. Insurers developed anti-concurrent provisions to prevent coverage from being triggered, regardless of what peril predominately caused the loss."
118,Anti-Indemnity Statute,An anti-indemnity statute is a law defining how much risk can be transferred between parties in a contract and is oftentimesused in construction contracts.,"An anti-indemnity statute protects sub-contractors from risks they take on from a primary contractor. In the insurance industry, financial risk is oftentimes transferred to reinsurers, which are companies that agree to take on some of the risk in exchange for some of the premium collected by the primary insurer."
119,Anti-Stacking Provisions,"Anti-Stacking Provisions an insurance policy provision which prevents more than one limit or deductible from applying to a single insured event. Anti-stacking provisions (or stacking provisions) are most commonly applied in situations in which exposure to an insured risk may last a long period of time. The longer the time period, the more likely the risk is to be covered under multiple policies. This type of provision is also referenced in auto insurance policies.","Anti-stacking provisions prevent an insured party from collecting damages from multiple insurance policies for a single occurrence. Insurance companies use these provisions to limit their liability. For example, an insurance company may consider water damage from several different leaks to be a single occurrence rather than treat each leak as a separate occurrence."
120,Any-Occupation Policy,"An any-occupation policy is a type of disability insurance which categorizes the kind of work for coverage purposes. Any-occupations coverage provides for when the insured is unable to work in a job that is reasonably suitable for them based on their education, experience, and age.","An any-occupation policy terminology, as used in disability insurance policies, identifythe conditions under which a policyholderreceives benefits. "
121,Appleton Rule,"The Appleton Rule is a regulation initiated in 1901 by New York Deputy Superintendent of Insurance Henry D. Appleton. The rule requires that every insurance company doing business in New York abide by New York state law, specifically the New York Insurance Code, even if it does business in other states. The Appleton Rule made New York a leader in insurance regulation and means that the Empire State is one of the most stringently regulated states for insurance companies to do business. Firms that don't comply with the Appleton Rule are at risk of losing their insurance license in the state.","The Appleton Rule was first enacted as an administrative regulation at the turn of the 20th Century, and in 1939, the it was incorporated into New York's state insurance laws. Although the regulation was popular in New York for its consumer protections, it was not as welcomed by companies looking to do business there and in other states because any proposed new regulation that would conflict or jeopardize New York state insurance licenses would meet opposition. The rule was also disliked by other state insurance commissioners because it prevented them from introducing different regulations if they opposed the Appleton rule."
122,Application Of Retention,"Application of retention is language within an insurance contract that specifies how much loss the insured is to retain for certain types of risk. Application of retention specifies whether losses are covered on a per-occurrence or per-accident basis, up to a certain amount through self-insurance. Insurance companies are only responsible for losses in excess of this retention.","Application of retention applies to liability insurance policies that may require the policy holder to retain losses until a certain limit is reached, after which the policy coverage will begin. This is called retention, and is similar to self-insurance in that the retention serves a similar function to a deductible. The amount of loss below the policy threshold is considered non-indemnified, meaning that a calculation of actual financial is not applied at the time of loss."
123,Apportionment,"An apportionment is theallocation of a loss between all of the insurance companies that insure a piece of property. This allocation is used to determine a percentage of liability for each insurer. For example, three insurers, thateach cover $30,000 on a $90,000 property are each apportioned a third of the claim if the property is destroyed. Apportionment can also refer to real estate or the distribution of economic benefit.","Apportionmentsmost often apply to situations of ""other"" or ""double""insurance,where two or more insurance policies are taken out on with the same insured party, on the same interest, onthe same subject, against the same risks.Apportionments are most often defined in an apportionment or ""other insurance""clause, whichis usuallypart of the associatedinsurance policy."
124,Appurtenance,"Appurtenance is a legal term denoting the attachment of a right or property to a more worthy principal. Appurtenance occurs when the attachment becomes part of the property such as a furnace or air conditioning unit.Appurtenance is also an object or privilege associated with status, title or affluence.","Appurtenance is usually applicable toproperty rights or items that are permanent and are passed along with the sale of the property. An appurtenance is real property, which has beendefinedas being immovable or fixed to the land. Appurtenancesrelate to the land.For legal transactions, appurtenances grant the ownership of certain items to a person who ownsproperty. For example, once a tenant installs a new water tank into the apartment, they usually can not remove the appurtenance because it is now part of the property."
125,Archer MSA,An Archer MSA is similar to an HSA in offering the account holder a tax-deferred way to save for medical expenses.,An MSA is a United States medical savings accountintroduced in the 1990s. It has largely been replaced by the more popular and flexible Health Savings Account (HSA). Congress created the MSA specifically for self-employed individuals and small businesses looking for new ways to provide health insurance. The account owner made regular payments to the MSA on a tax-free basis for fund withdrawal on qualifying medical expenses. All of the monies put into the MSA came from the employee or the employer but not both. Account holders would incur penalties if they withdrew funds for non-medical uses.
126,Architects And Engineers (A&E) Liability Coverage,Architects and Engineers (A&E) liability coverage is professional liability insurance that provides coverage to architects and engineers from errors and omissions claims.,"Architects and engineers liability coverage, also called A&E liability coverage, can be purchased by a wide range of building professionals, including electrical or structural engineers, construction managers, surveyors, or design and build architects. The policy typically lasts for a single year, and is purchased for the firm rather than for a specific architect."
127,As Their Interests May Appear (ATIMA),"As their interests may appear (ATIMA)is text in an insurance policy that allows other parties to be added to the coverage.As their interests may appear, or ATIMA, allows an additional insured party to receive insurance coverage without having to list out each insured's interest in the policy.","When a company purchases an insurance policy, it becomes the named insured, but in many cases there are other individuals or groups that also have insurable interests. Another firm may have rented equipment to the named insured, for example. These other parties may be listed in the policy as anadditional insured, but rather than list out every item owned by the additional insured that is covered under the policy, the contract will sayas their interests may appear."
128,Assailing Thieves,"Individuals who are not members of a ship's crew who steal a ships cargo by threatening violence. Assailing thieves is a term used in marine insurance policies, and is a peril that policies cover. In some cases, the theft of the ship itself may be covered under the marine policy, though this can be disputed.","Shipping companies face a number of perils when transporting products across the ocean. The ship may be caught in a storm and may eventually founder, or the cargo may be damaged by wind or waves. In some cases, individuals who are not members of the crew or passengers of the ship may board the ship with the intent to steal the cargo. Insurers refer to these individuals as assailing thieves."
129,Assessable Policy,"An Assessable Policy is a type of insurance policy that may require the policyholder to pay additional funds to cover an insurers losses if the losses are greater than the insurers reserves. They are most commonly associated with mutual insurance companies, which are formed by a group of individuals and businesses to provide insurance coverage to members.","Individuals and businesses are likely to be familiar with large insurance companies that provide a variety of different types of policies. In some cases, however, a group of businesses may pool funds together and form a corporation specifically to purchase insurance coverage for the group. The corporation formed is called a mutual company or mutual insurance company, and allows members to obtain insurance coverage at a cheaper rate than if they sought coverage on their own."
130,Assigned Risk,Assigned risk is when an insurance company is required to provide coverage for by state insurance law. An assigned risk is typically a risk that may be difficult to find coverage for in the general marketplace. Regulators deal with assigned risks by requiring insurers to pool together to provide coverage.,"In most cases, insurance companies choose who they underwrite insurance policies for. This choice is based on the risk profile of the insured, including the likelihood that a claim that results in a loss will be made. The insurer will price the cost of the policy it underwrites according to the potential severity of any losses. If a potential insured is deemed too risky, the insurer may not underwrite a new policy."
131,Associate In Claims (AIC),"An Associate in Claims is a professional designation forprofessionals with enhanced skill training to handle different types of claims.

145,Assumed Interest Rate (AIR),"The assumed interest rate (AIR) is the rateof interest orgrowth rateselected by an insurance company. The assumed interest rate is provided to determine the value of an annuity contract and, therefore, the periodic income payment provided to the annuitant. Combined with other factors such as the annuitant's age upon annuitization, spousal coverage options and the type of annuity coverage chosen, the AIR determines the monthly payment the annuitant will receive.","In other words,assumed interest rate (AIR)is the minimum interest rate that must be earned on investments in the policyholder's cash-value account in order to cover the insurance company's costs and expected profit margin. A larger AIR will result in a more robust prediction for market returns,as well asgreater monthly income payment for the annuitant."
146,Assumption Endorsement,"Assumption Endorsement states that , should the original insurer become insolvent, any claim covered by the reinsurance will be paid directly to the policyholder by the reinsurer, rather than through the traditional channels. This is not intended to increase the risk to the reinsurer but, rather, to expedite the claims process. Also called a ""cut-through endorsement.""","The assumption, or cut-through, endorsement derives its name from the fact that it ""cuts through"" the proverbial ""red tape"" so often associated with insurance claims, providing prompter, hassle-free payments of claims, at least in theory."
147,Assurance,"Assurance refers to financial coverage that provides remuneration for an event that is certain to happen. Assurance is similar to insurance, with the terms often used interchangeably. Insurance refers to coverage over a limited time, whereas assurance applies to coverage for extended periods or until death. Assurance may also apply to validation services provided by accountants and other professionals.","One of the best examples of assurance is whole life insurance as opposed to term life insurance. (In the United Kingdom, ""life assurance"" is another name for life insurance.) The adverse event that both whole life and term life insurance deal with is the death of the person the policy covers. Since the death of the covered person is certain, a life assurance policy (whole life insurance) results in payment to the beneficiary when the policyholder dies."
148,Asymmetric Information,"Asymmetric information, also known as information failure, occurs when one party to an economic transaction possesses greater material knowledge than the other party. This normally manifests when the seller of a good or service has greater knowledge than the buyer, although the reverse is possible. Almost all economic transactions involve information asymmetries.","Asymmetric information is the specialization and division of knowledge in society as applied to economic trade. For example, medical doctors typically know more about medical practice than their patients. After all, through extensive education and training, doctors specialize in medicine, whereas most patients do not. The same principle applies to architects, teachers, police officers, attorneys, engineers, fitness instructors, and other specially trained professionals."
149,Attained Age,"Attainedage is the age at which the beneficiary of an insurance policy, retirement plan or other aged-dependent plan, is able to receive benefits or withdraw funds. Attained age can be any age at which benefits are received. In some cases, the person may have to take action when he reaches the attained age, such as retiring from a company. Attained age can also be an individual policyholder's age at a specific point in time. Attained age can be used to calculate pricing in policies that set payments according to the policy holder's age. Typically, the pricing increases as the policy holder ages.","Attained age pricing adjusts pricing according to age. The older the policy holder, the more that policy holder pays to remain covered. This type of policy may have lower initial expenses, but may become more expensive than issue-age pricing or community-rated pricing as the policy holder ages."
150,Attractive Nuisances,"An attractive nuisance is anitem, located on a property, that is appealing but potentially hazardous, especially to children. Attractive nuisances can lead to expensive injuries and pricey lawsuits that insurance companies are reluctant to cover. As a result, insurers may require property owners to remove or mitigate an attractive nuisance before they will extend coverage. If they do extend coverage, the policy may be more expensive than an otherwise identical one that did not cover the attractive nuisance.","Examples of attractive nuisances include swimming pools and other water features (e.g., fountains and ponds), construction sites, power lines, wells and drainage ditches, old appliances sitting in the backyard (children can play in them and get trapped inside), playgrounds and trampolines. Owning a property that contains an attractive nuisance is a good reason to purchase the maximum amount of liability coverage available under your homeowners insurance policy and to supplement that with an umbrella policy, which will provide another $1 million or more in liability coverage. Attractive nuisances need not always be aesthetically pleasing – ""attractive"" really refers to the attractive nature of the feature to children and the accompanying dangers and liabilities that come with them."
151,Auto Insurance,"An auto insurance is a policy purchased by vehicle owners to mitigate costs associated with getting into an auto accident. Instead of paying out of pocket for auto accidents, people pay annual premiums to an auto insurance company; the company then pays all or most of the costs associated with an auto accident or other vehicle damage.","Auto insurance premiumsvary depending onage, gender, years of driving experience, accident and moving violation historyand other factors. Most states mandate that all vehicle owners purchase a minimum amount of auto insurance, but many people purchase additional insurance to further protect themselves."
152,Automatic Additional Insured,"Automatic additional insured refers to additional insurance coverage that is automatically included in an insurance policy. The automatic additional insured endorsement is attached to the policy, and allows the policyholder to avoid having to list out each party that needs to be covered under the insurance policy.","Businesses that purchase liability insurance often request additional protection for contractors and other parties to be ""automatic additional insured"" because they arecollaboratingon a project with the primary insured. Thisadditional coverage is purchased in order to protect the business from any liabilities stemming from the activities undertaken by the contractor. Since the request for additional protection is such a common occurrence, insurance companies have started to incorporate automatic coverage."
153,Automatic Premium Loan,Automatic premium loan is aninsurance policy provision that allows the insurer to deduct the amount of the outstanding premium from the value of the policy when the premium is due. Automatic premium loan provisions are most commonly associated with life insurance policiesand allowthe policy to continue to be in force rather than lapsing.,"Depending on the policy language, life insurance policyholders may be able to take out a loan against the cash value of thepolicy. With such apolicy, every premium you payadds to the cash value of the policy. This accrued cash value is a value over and above the face value of the policy, and can be borrowed against by the policyholder at his or her discretion. Since the accrued value is technically the property of the policyholder, borrowing against the cash value does not require a credit application, loan collateralor other good faith requirements typically found in loans.The loan is taken out against the cash value of the policy, and theloan balance is deducted from the policys cash value ifnot repaid. The policyholder will owe interest on the loan, just as with a standard loan. The policy contracts language may indicate that no loans may be taken out unless the premium has been paid in full."
154,Automobile Liability Insurance,"Automobile liability insurance is financial protection for a driver who, while operating a vehicle, harms someone else or their property. Automobile liability insurance only covers injuries or damages to third parties and their property, not to the driver or the drivers property. The two components of automobile liability insurance are bodily injury liability and property damage liability. Automobile liability insurance does not have a deductible.","Bodily injury liability of an automobile liability insurance policy covers an at-fault driver, so they don't have out-of-pocket expenses for others'emergency and ongoing medical expenses, loss of income and funeral costs. It also helps cover the policyholders legal fees when the accident results in a lawsuit. Property damage liability helps cover costs, such as repairing a home or retail establishment damaged by a vehicle crash and repairing the vehicles of other drivers involved in the accident. Automobile liability insurance has two limits for each of these components; one is per person and one is per accident."
155,Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME),"Average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) isa calculation used to determine the primary insurance amount (PIA), which isused to value an individual's social security benefits. The average indexed monthly earningstakes thetop 35 highest earning years up to age 60 and indexes it for wage growth, and then averages it to get a monthly amount. The AIME tries to approximateearnings over alifetime at today's wage levels.","In order to calculate the PIA, the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME)is split into three parts. Predetermined percentages are applied to each part, and they are all summed together to get the PIA.If someonereceives Social Security benefits, the number they useto calculate that benefit is from the primary insurance amount (PIA)."
156,Average Severity,Average severity is the amount of loss associated with an average insurance claim. Average severity is calculated by dividing the total amount of losses that an insurance company experiences by the number of claims that were made against policies that it underwrites.,"Average severity is used to show the observed amount of loss for the average claim, or it may be an estimate of the amount of loss an insurer should expect from the average claim in the future."
157,Aviation Accident Insurance,"Aviation Accident Insurance provides coverage for injuries resulting from an aircraft accident. Aviation accident insurance covers injuries sustained by pilots as well as travelers, with the type of coverage typically accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D).","While the likelihood of sustaining an injury during a flight is low, the potential for accidental death or injury is a risk that can be insured against. Because the demand for aviation accident insurance is less than the demand for many other types of insurance, such as general liability or life insurance, the number of insurance companies offering this type of policy is relatively small."
158,Back Pay,Back pay is the amount of salary and other benefits that an employee claims that he or she is owed after a wrongful termination. Back pay is typically calculated from the date of termination to the date a claim was finalized or judgment was rendered.,"The amount of time it takes an insurance company to complete the claims process and determine if back pay is duedepends on the complexity of the case. In some instances, a claim may be resolved quickly, such as in the case of an automobile accident that only involved damage to the body of the vehicle. Other cases, however, may take years to fully settle. In the case of a wrongful termination claim being made by an employee, the company will be liable for the salary and benefits that the employee would have earned had he or she not been terminated."
159,Back Up,"Back up is financial jargon for the movement in a security's spread, price, or yield before issue. It is characterized by an increase in bond yields and a decrease in price. Simply stated, the price of a security ""backs up"" when a company finds the security more costly to issue when raising funds.","When a back up occurs, the fund-raising efforts of a company are diminished. For example, if interest rates increase, the required yields on most bonds rise as well. This forces a company to either raise the coupon on its bond issue, which increases the interest payment, or sell the bonds at a discount, reducing the level of incoming cash."
160,Back-To-Back Deductible,"A back-to-back deductible is a feature of an insurance policy under which the deductible equals the policy amount. This is a type of a fronting policy, in which the insured covers any damages and thus relieves the insurer of any risk.","A back-to-back deductible allows a policyholder to essentially self-insure with the assistance of a licensed insurance provider. It is also sometimes referred to as a matching deductible. The policyholder assumes the burden of covering any claims against itself, since the deductible is identical to the value of the policy."
161,Backdated Liability Insurance,"Backdated liability insuranceprovides coverage for a claim that occurred before the insurance policy was purchased. Backdated liability insurance is not an insurance product frequently offered by insurers, since the insurer cannot be certain how much the loss will amount to.","Companies purchase backdatedliability insurance coverage to protect themselves from risks that may arise from past business activities. It covers possible gaps in coverage that are only discovered after a loss event occurs. The company that experiences this loss can either self-insure, meaning that it pays for the loss itself, or can try to purchase a backdated liability insurance policy that will cover the loss."
162,Bad Faith Insurance,"Bad faith insurance refers to an insurers attempt to renegeon its obligations to its clients, either through refusal to pay a policyholders legitimate claimor investigate and process a policyholders claim within a reasonable period.","Insurance companies act in bad faith when they misrepresent an insurance contracts language to the policyholder to avoid paying a claim. They also act in bad faith when they fail to disclose policy limitations and exclusions to policyholders before they purchase a policy, or when they make unreasonable demands on the policyholder to prove a covered loss."
163,Bailee's Customers Insurance,"Bailee's customers insurance provides coverage for the legal liability ofdamage or destruction of a bailor's property while under the care of a bailee. A bailee is a person or organization that has temporary possession of someone else's personal property (dry cleaner, parking valet, jewelers, repairers, etc.)","Bailee's customers insurance providescoverage forproperty that is on, or in transit to and from, the bailee's premises. Events and perils covered in such policies include fire, lightning, theft, burglary, robbery, explosion, collision, flood, earthquake and damage or destruction in the course of transportation by a carrier. The insuranceis in effect when the bailee issues a receipt to the bailor for the item. Coverage excludes property belonging to the insured bailee and loss due to vermin and insects."
164,Balance Billing,Balance billing is a practice by a health care provider that bills the patient for the difference between what the provider charges and what insurance covers.,"Balance billing occurs when the patients provider is out-of-network or if a particular service isnt covered. It is not uncommon for balance billing to surprise patients who assumed that by seeing an in-network provider, all services and referrals would likely be covered by their insurance. In reality, it is all too common for referred providers or partnered services, such as lab testing, to be out-of-network and therefore subject to balance billing."
165,Bancassurance,"Bancassurance is an arrangement between a bank and an insurance company allowing the insurance company to sell its products to the bank's client base. This partnership arrangement can be profitable for both companies. Banks earn additional revenue by selling insurance products, and insurance companies expand their customer bases without increasing their sales force or paying agent and broker commissions.","The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 prohibited U.S. banks from entering into business with firms that provided another type of financial service. In 1999, most of the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed allowing bancassurance, also known as Allfinanz. However, it still has not been fully accepted as a practice for most forms of insurance. "
166,Bank Insurance,"Bank insurance is a guarantee by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of deposits in a bank. Created in 1989, the Bank Insurance Fund is the federal fund used to insure bank deposits of national and state banksthat are members of the federal reserve system. Bank insurance helps protect individuals who deposit their savings in banks, against commercial bank insolvency. Each depositor is insured to at least $250,000 per bank.","The FDIC, an independent U.S. government corporation, was initiated under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. Its purpose was to insure bank deposits against loss and to regulate banking practices. The collapse of a great majority of banks in the United States, during the Great Depression, prompted the creation of the FDIC.FDIC deposit insurance coverage depends on two things: whether your chosen financial product is a deposit productandwhether your bank is FDIC-insured.If your insured bank fails, FDIC insurance will cover your deposit accounts, dollar for dollar up to the insurance limit, including principal and any accrued interest through the date of the insured banks closing."
167,Bank Insurance Fund (BIF),"Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) is a unit of the FDIC that provides insurance protections for banks that are not classified as a savings and loan association. As with all FDIC protection, the BIF provides coverage of up to $250,000 per customer account for insolvent banks. The BIF was created as a result of the savings and loan meltdown in the late eighties.","The creation of the BIF resulted in two separate branches of FDIC coverage. One is the BIF, while the other is the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). However, the insurance funds for these two entities were merged by Congress in 2006into the Deposit Insurance Fund."
168,Bank Letter Of Credit Policy,A bank letter of credit policy is an insurance policy held by U.S. banks to ensure the authenticity of letters of credit issued by foreign financial institutions.,"A bank letter of credit policy reduces the risk a bank takes when it engages in foreign transactions. A letter of credit is a payment mechanism used in international trade to guarantee payment of a specific amount at a specific time. Issuing banks fund letters of credit based upon collateral pledged by the party on whose behalf the bank will guarantee payment. International trade relies heavily on letters of credit to reduce friction when parties do not have an existing financial relationship, and therefore cannot accurately gauge the reliability of contracting parties. In effect, the issuing bank underwrites the buyer's credit risk and acts as a trusted counterparty."
169,Bank-Owned Life Insurance - BOLI,"Bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) is a form of life insurance purchased by banks where the bank is the beneficiary and also usually owner of the policy. Such an insurance is used as a tax shelter for the financial institutions, which leverage its tax-free savings provisions as funding mechanisms for employee benefits.","BOLI contracts are primarily used by banks to fund employee benefits at a much lower rate than they might have to pay otherwise. The process works like this: The bank sets up the contract, and then makes payments into a specialized fund set aside as the insurance trust."
170,Banker's Blanket Bond,Bankers blanket bond (BBB) is a fidelity bond purchased from an insurance broker that protects a bank against losses from a variety of criminal acts carried out by employees. Some states require blanket bond coverage as a condition of operating a bank. ,Bankers blanket bond is also known as a blanket fidelity bond.
171,Bankers Professional Liability (BPL) Insurance,Financial protection for financial professionals against customers claims of wrongdoing. Bankers professional liability insurance is a type of errors and omissions insurance that protects those who work in the banking industry and the institutions they work for from the expenses associated with defending oneself in a lawsuit or paying a judgment if a plaintiff wins.,"The termbanker is broad in this context; bankers professional liability insurance may cover escrow agents, tax planners, financial planners, estate planners and more. Bankers liability insurance can cover directors, officers, full-time, part-time and seasonal workers in these professions."
172,Bare Walls Coverage,Bare walls coverage is an insurance policy that applies to communally used features inmulti-family residentialbuildings. Bare walls coverage is generally found in master policies for condominium associations.,"Bare walls coverage is used when the structure of a building is shared by many different people which makes it difficult for any one person to carry the insurance policy on the property. In multifamily houses or condominiums this can reference areas like entryways or firewalls between units. Since a single unit owner cannot be asked to purchase a policy covering these items, the association purchases this insurance policy. Usually the cost of the premiums for this policy are included in the associations fees."
173,Basic Extended Reporting Period (BERP),"A basic extended reporting period is a reporting period extension provided to claims-made liability policyholders. Basic extended reporting period (BERP) applies to claims made after the retroactive date, and after the policy has been canceled, non-renewed, or changed to a different type of liability policy.","The extended reporting period provision is added to the policy contract, and allows the policyholder to continue to report claims to the insurance company. The reporting period is typically extended for a finite period of time, such as 60 days."
174,Basic Premium Factor,"Basic Premium Factor is the acquisition expenses, underwriting expenses and profit, as well as the loss conversion factor adjusted for the insurance charge for a policy. The basic premium factor is used in the calculation of retrospective premiums. It does not take into account taxes or claims adjustment expenses, which are instead covered in the other components of the retrospective premium calculation.",The basic premium factor is determined after an insurer sets the standard premium. A policys retrospective premium is calculated as (basic premium + converted losses) x tax multiplier. The basic premium is calculated by multiplying the basic premium factor by the standard premium. The converted loss is calculated by multiplying the loss conversion factor by the losses incurred. The basic premium is less than the standard premium because of the basic premium factor.
175,Basic Reparations Benefits,"Basic reparations benefits are automobile insurancebenefitsthat provide medical, economicand other loss coverage up to a predetermined limit. The terms basic reparations benefits (BRB), personal injury protection and no-fault insurance are often used interchangeably. This coverage is known as no-fault because it pays out claims regardless of who is at fault in the accident.It applies to injuries sustained by the driver as well aspassengers in the vehicle, and sometimes alsopedestrians.","Basic reparations benefits typically cover three types of costs: medical, incomeand essential services."
176,Basket Deductible,"A basket deductible is asingle deductible that is designed to pay for losses from different types of risks. A basket deductible is designed to reduce the risk associated with business transactions, such as the purchase of another company, by outlining indemnification and indicating the point at which the seller may be responsible for claims.",A basket deductiblelimits indemnification obligations to prevent an indemnifying party from being liable for inaccuracies in or breaches of certain representations until losses exceed a specified minimum amount.
177,Basket Retention,Basket retention policies are pre-packaged insurance policies covering several risks and typically cost the insurer less than covering each risk under its own policy or rider.,"Basket retention is most commonly found with self-insurance, alternative risk transfer techniques and reinsurance. Companies will use basket retention as an excess indemnity insurancecontract."
178,Batch Clause,"Batch Clause is a policy provision of product liability insurance that limits coverage to claims stemming from defective products from a specific production cycle. A batch clause thus only covers items produced during a specific production run over a specific time period, referred to as abatch.","Professional liability policies may have a batch clause that limits the amount of deductible that can apply to an event, such as a defective product, regardless of the number of claims filed for damages caused by that product. This prevents the policyholder from having to consider every claim to be a separate occurrence. This will only be the case if the policy language says that the deductible is on aper occurrence basis. If the deductible is on aper claim basis then it applies to each claim made, which means that the insured will have to pay more money out of pocket if multiple claims are made."
179,Beach Plan,"A beach plan is property insurance for coastal property owners who have a high exposure to windstorm and hail losses. A beach plan is designed to cover losses that a regular homeowners insurance policy does not and has a separate deductible. Further, instead of a dollar amount deductible, such as $5,000, beach plans have a percentage deductible based on the homes insured value.","If your home is valued at $250,000 and your beach plan deductible is 5 percent, youll pay $12,500 before your insurance policy will pay anything. Without these high deductibles, insurance companies wouldnt be able to afford to offer beach plans at all. Windstorm losses can be extremely expensive for insurers since they cause major damage and affect numerous policyholders simultaneously."
180,Benchmark Surplus,"Benchmark surplus is an insurance term that refers to the amount of surplus from an additional capital source, which necessarily acts as a supplement to the company's cash flow.",Benchmark surplus would be required when unforeseen contingencies occur that could disrupt or impair the cash flow necessary for an insurance company to make future benefit payments for which it has already received the premiums.
181,Benefit Period,"A benefit period is the length of time during which a policyholder or their dependents may file and receive payment for a covered hazard. All insuranceplans willinclude a benefitperiod, which canvary by policy type, insuranceprovider, and policy premium. Most individuals are familiarwith the benefit period for health care insurance, but disability, long-term care,homeowner's and auto insurancepolicies will also carry a benefit period. ","The benefit period of an insurance policy will impactthe price of the premium since an insurer faces a more significant risk when the period is longer. Towards the end of the benefit period, the insurer will notify the policyholder of the cost to renew the same coverage for the following term. The policyholder must submit the premium payment for the next term before the expiration date of the current coverage for benefit periods to continue, uninterrupted."
182,Benefit-Expense Ratio,"Theinsuranceindustry usesbenefit-expense ratio to describe the proportion of money taken in by a company compared to what is paid out in claims. It is a crucial operating metric calculated by dividing a company's costs associated with providing insurance coverage by the revenues from premiumscharged for that coverage. Because of the significant dollar values involved, a single percentage change in the benefit expense ratio can significantly impact the corporation's net income.​​​​​​​","Benefit-expense ratio compares an insurer's expenses for underwriting insurance to the revenues it receives from those policies. Generally, insurance providers would want to minimize this ratio as it would indicate an increase in top-linegrowth relative to expenses.The top line on a business financial statement is for reporting gross revenue. This line shows the full value of services sold to customers. Subsequent lines will list expenses and will reduce the top-line amount."
183,Benefits Payable Exclusion,A benefits payable exclusion is a clause in an insurance policy that removes the insurers responsibility for paying out claims related to employee benefits if the insured is able to pay them from another source.,"Benefits payable exclusions apply to benefits-related liabilities for which the company is responsible, not the insurer."
184,Best's Capital Adequacy Relativity (BCAR),"Best's Capital Adequacy Relativity is a rating of the strength of an insurance companys balance sheet. Bests capital adequacy ratio, also known as BCAR, examines an insurers leverage, underwriting activities, and financial performance and uses this information to test various scenarios to see how each would impact the insurers balance sheet.","Best'sCapitalAdequacy Relativity(BCAR) was developed by A.M. Best, a rating agency that focuses on the insurance industry. BCARdepicts the quantitative relationship between an insurance company'sbalance sheet strength and its operating risks. As the foundation of financial security, balance sheet strength is critical to the determination of a rating units ability to meet its current and ongoing obligations."
185,Betterment Insurance,Betterment insurance is coverage for additions or modifications made by alesseeto a space they lease. Such policies cover only improvements which increase the value of the property and do not include the structure itself.,"Betterment insurance policies typically cover improvements made tocommercial properties. However, residential tenants could also purchase sucha policyif circumstances warranted.Betterment insurance protects the tenant fromfinancial harm whichwould occur if they were unable to use or benefit fromimprovements they make to a leased structure. This coverage is also known as betterment and improvementcoverage."
186,Bid Deduct,"Bid deduct is a feature of an owner controlled insurance program (OCIP) in which contractors' bids include the cost of providing workers' compensation, general liability, and excess liability insurance. The bid deduct methodology will reduce the final amount awarded on the contract based on these insurance deductions.",Also known as insurance credit.
187,Bikini Deductible,"A bikini deductible is a portion of risk, separating the primary layer and the excess layer of risk. The bikini deductible, also called corridor self-insured retention, represents risk that a company self-insures against. It is so named because the layers of coverage loosely resemble the bikini bathing suit: a thin layer of protection at the top and at the bottom, but no protection in the middle.","Insurance coverage can be expensive, and companies looking to insure against specific risks want to make sure that they are only purchasing the amount of coverage that they really need. Just as insurers make estimates as to the amount of losses they might expect to experience from a particular policy, so to do businesses estimate the likelihood that a claim will result from the work that they do."
188,Bilateral Extended Reporting Period Provision,"Bilateral Extended Reporting Period Provision is a reporting period extension provided to policyholders in claims-made liability insurance policies. These provisions apply to claims made after the retroactive date, and after the policy has been canceled, non-renewed, or changed to a different type of liability policy.",Also called two-tail or two-way extended reporting provisions.
189,Bilateral Trade,"A bilateral trade is the exchange of goods between two nations promoting trade and investment. The two countries willreduce or eliminate tariffs, import quotas, export restraints, and other trade barriers to encourage trade and investment. In the United States, the Office of Bilateral Trade Affairs minimizes trade deficits through negotiating free trade agreements with new countries, supporting and improving existing trade agreements, promoting economic development abroad, and other actions.","The goals of bilateral trade agreements are to expand access between two countries markets and increase their economic growth. Standardized business operations in five general areas prevent one country from stealing anothers innovative products, dumping goods at a small cost, or using unfair subsidies. Bilateral trade agreements standardize regulations, labor standards, and environmental protections."
190,Bingo Card Program,The bingo card program wasmotor vehicle registration method that required the operator of a motor vehicle to carry a card that was stamped by each statethe vehicle was operated in. Bingo card programs showed which states the driver had the proper insurance and licensure in. The card that the driver carried was marked by a stamping devicesimilar to the ones used in the game of bingo.,"Bingo card programs allowed states to monitor which drivers were allowed to operate a motor vehicle at a time when digital records were not yet in use. Having an up-to-date card mattered to interstate drivers the most, as drivers that never left their state didnt have to worry about having the proper stamps issued by other states. Interstate drivers had to make sure that they had proof of insurance and any applicable liability policies needed to operate the motor vehicle, and commercial carriers could not operate more vehicles than theyhad stampsfor without running the risk of being found out during a traffic stop."
191,Bioavailability,"Bioavailability refers to the portion of a nutrient that reaches the human bloodstream. When discussing a drug, bioavailability can refer to either the percentage of a dose that reaches its target or the rate at which it achieves the bloodstream. Bioavailability can be an important factor in the efficacy and commercial viability of that drug.","Bioavailability is a term taken from the field of pharmacokinetics, the study of the movement of drugs through the human body. In scientific notation, it is represented by a capital or lowercase F. The term can describe the delivery of food nutrients to the circulatory system, which can be affected by a range of physiological variables such as body weight and metabolism. The pharmacological definition, however, is designed to assign an absolute bioavailability to each drug, consistent among identical dosages of that drug, and unaffected by those physiological factors. This definition can expressed by the following formula:"
192,Biotech Compound,"Biotech compound refers to a chemical that shows potential for therapeutic application in the earliest stage of the development process. This stage is known as the drug discovery phase. It involves experimental modifications to the compound to identify the most promising candidate for further research in the next stage, known as drug development.","A biotech compound, also known as a lead compound, is an early but promising treatment for a disease. The first step in the selection of a biotech compound is the identification of a biological target. This is a molecule in the human body, most commonly a protein, which either causes a disease or modifies a disease in a way which complicates treatment. In order to remedy the effects of the malignant molecule, researchers determine whether the molecule needs to be inhibited or or stimulated. They will also consider the structure of the target molecule and consider compounds which will form the strongest structural bond with the target. Computer modeling is a recently common tool for identification of biotech compounds through structural analysis."
193,Biotechnology,"Biotechnology is the use of living organisms to make products or run processes. Biotechnology is best known for its huge role in the field of medicine, and is also used in other areas such as food and fuel.","Biotechnology involves understanding how living organisms function at the molecular level, so it combines a number of disciplines including biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, science and technology. Modern biotechnology continues to make very significant contributions to extending the human lifespan and improving the quality of life through numerous ways, including providing products and therapies to combat diseases, generating higher crop yields, and using biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hungarian engineer Karl Ereky reportedly coined the termbiotechnology, which is often referred to asbiotech, in 1919."
194,Black Box Insurance,"Black box insurance, also known as telematics insurance, is an insurance program that offers premiums based on current driving behavior as opposed to historical performance. Black box insurance aims to match motorists with personalized premiums according to their driving performance.","Financial sectors like insurance have implemented new technology in their processes to improve delivery and services to policy owners. Insurtech, a combination of insurance and technology, uses tremendous amounts of user datato reduce dangerous driving, reward good driving behavior, and boost customer satisfaction. Insurance companies use telematics technology to create the black box by fusing data from telecommunications and informatics applied in wireless devices like cellphones and GPS."
195,Blanket Additional Insured Endorsement,"A blanket additional insured endorsement is an insurance policy endorsement that automatically provides coverage to any party to whichthe named insured is contractually required to provide coverage. A blanket additional insured endorsement is most commonly found in liability insurance policies, though it is typically not a common feature of the policy language.","Blanket additional insured endorsements do not require the named insured to identify the additional insured by name. Instead, the named insured will provide a general description of the type of groups that it wants policy coverage to be extended to."
196,Blanket Contractual Liability Insurance,"Blanket contractual liability insuranceis liability insurance that provides coverage for all contracts in which the insured is assuming liability. Blanket contractual liability insurance is most commonly used in situations in which a business is working with a third party,especially if that third party is using the business property.","Blanket contractual liability insurance is designed to be automatically applicable to any agreement that abusiness may sign.Businesses are more than willing to accept payment from other companies, but are much less willing to accept risks that come along with the arrangement. In order to protect itself, a business may require other companies to maintain various types of liability insurance policies. These policies protect both the insured party and the parties with whomthe insured works.Thecoverage is designed to indemnify orhold harmless another person or entity for actions not specifically excluded on the insurance policy. This type of coverage may be included on a policy, or it can be added with an additional endorsement."
197,Blanket Insurance,"Blanket insurance is a single property insurancepolicythat covers more than one type of property at the same location, the same kind of property at multiplelocations, or multiplekinds or property at two or more locations. It covers personal possessions as well as the actual dwelling, ""blanketing"" all the homeowners'possessions.","Blanket insurance usuallyoffers a broader setof protections than a typicalindividual policy. Although it's more expensive, the additional covered perils often make it worth the investment. It's important to examine a prospectiveblanket insurance policy closely andcompare it to conventional policiesto see what you would get for the extra cost."
198,Blanket Medical Expense,Blanket Medical Expense is an insurance policy which provides coverage for all medical expenses below an aggregate limit. This insurance does not place limits on the type of medical services or procedures that the policyholder undertakes.,"Insurance companies often create restrictions on the types of procedures, tests, and services that are covered by a policy. This helps put downward pressure on costs by removing the pay-for-service incentive for the medical professional. Insurance companies may, for example, link financial incentives for doctors to improve the long-term health of the patients covered by the policy."
199,Blended Covers,"Blended covers are a form of reinsurance that combines features of finite and convention reinsurance. Blended reinsurance includes the transfer of underwriting risk from the ceding company to the reinsurer, which is a more traditional form of reinsurance, with policies that may last multiple years. It is a type of alternative risk transfer.","Blended covers represent an evolution of insurance and financial products resulting from increased competition. They allow financial and insurance companies to better meet the needs of their clients. They arose in the 1980s in response to a period of time in which insurance premiums were considered volatile. By shifting to multi-year contracts, the reinsurer and ceding company are able to reduce the costs associated with renewal negotiations, and a focus on individual loss experience rather than on the markets loss experience rewards companies that are able to reduce their risk profiles."
200,Block Policy,"A block policy is an all risk insurance policy providing coverage against risks faced by goods transportedor storedby third parties. Commonly found in commercial insurance, a block policy is designed to protect businesses from property damage.","Most companies will purchaseproperty insurance. This type of insurance provides protection for buildings, equipment, and inventory. However, once stock leaves the premises, property coverage no longer insures it. To further protect goods shipped from business to customer, there is a need for inland marine insurance, also known as a block policy."
201,Boat Owners' Insurance,"Boat owners insurance provides coverage for individuals who own and operate a boat or personal watercraft. Insurance may be purchased for sailboats, houseboats and others.","Boat owners insurance covers the boat and also the items needed to operate the boat safely, such as life vests, oars and anchors. Boat owners can also purchase additional coverage for electronic equipment, such as televisions, GPS and radios, as well as equipment commonly associated with boats, such as snorkels or SCUBA gear."
202,Bobtail Liability,Bobtail liability is an automobile insurance policy that covers the owner or operator of a semi truck which is not currently being used for transporting goods. Bobtail liability is purchased by drivers to bridge the coverage gap created when the driver is no longer covered by a companys liability insurance policy.,"“Bobtail refers to a truck when it either does not have a trailer attached to it or it has a trailer attached, but it's empty.Bobtail liability is also known as deadheading liability."
203,Boiler And Machinery (BM) Insurance,"Boiler And Machinery Insurance (BM) provides coverage for physical damage to and financial loss from equipment breakdown.Boiler and machinery insurance, also called equipment breakdown insurance, coversthe cost of repairing or replacing the damaged equipment andbusiness losses incurred from the equipment not functioning. This type of insurance can cover a wide range of equipment, including HVAC systems, ovens, boilers and furnaces, refrigeration units, elevators, and office equipment.","Boiler and machinery insurance covers the risk thatequipment,used by abusiness to deliver goods and provide services,will not function properly. Companies purchase this type of insurance to protect equipment much in the same way asproperty insurance protectsbuildingsand liability insurance protectsworkers from injuries. Property insurance policies may exclude coverage for common equipment faults, such as overheating, electrical failuresand mechanical breakdowns."
204,Book Runner,"The book runner is the primary underwriter or lead coordinator in the issuance of new equity, debt, or securities instruments. In investment banking, the book runner is the underwriting firm that runs or is in charge ofthe books. A large, leveraged buyout could involve multiple businesses; the book runner, representing one of the participating companies, coordinates with the other participating firms. Typically, one company takes the responsibility of running or managing the books, though more than one book runner (joint book runner) can control a security issuance.","In investment banking, a syndicate is a group of underwriters who are responsible for placing a new equity, debt, or security issue with investors. To reduce risk, the book runner syndicates with other underwriting firms for the issuance of the new equity, debt or security. Also called managing underwriter or syndicate manager, the book runner is listed first among the other underwriters participating in the issuance. They will typically assign parts of the new issue to other underwriting firms for placement while retaining the most significant portion forthemselves."
205,Boom Coverage,Boom coverage is a term used in the insurance industry to describe coverage for damages caused by cranes.,"Boom coverage is an endorsement or addition to a policy insuring a contractors equipment. Boom coverage specifically deals with damage caused by cranes and is usually an add-on policy feature, meaning that if an individual accepts this feature their premium paid for their insurance policy increases. Contractors generally have insurance in the form of contractors professional liability insurance, a form of insurance purposely designed to cover risks not covered by commercial general liability, helping to fully protect the contractor. Contractors professional liability insurance differs from the builders risk coverage which protects similar sets of conditions, types of loss and entities involved in a building project. However, contractors professional liability insurance is taken out by a contractor, while the owner of the project takes out builders risk coverage. It may be of interest to the contractor to additionally insure their equipment with boom coverage, even if the equipment is covered by a builders risk policy. "

This technique was created by two actuaries, Bornhuetter and Ferguson, and was first presented in 1975.","Bornhuetter-Ferguson is one of the most-widely used loss reserve valuation methods, second only to the chain-ladder method. It combines features of the chain ladder and expected loss ratio methodsand assigns weights for the percentage of losses paid and losses incurred. Unlike the chain ladder method, which builds a model based on past experience, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson technique builds a model based on the insurers exposure to loss."
209,Borrowed Servant Rule,Borrowed Servant Rule is alegal doctrine indicating that an employer may be held liable for the actions of a temporary employee.,"The borrowed servant rule shifts liability from the workers regular employer to the employer that is temporarily borrowing the worker.

For example, the replacement of New York's 3.1 mile long Tappan Zee Bridge cost$3.98 billion andis one of the largest single design-build contracts for a transportation project in the United States."
213,Broad Evidence Rule,"The broad evidence rule outlines the guidelines that insurers must go about in determining the value of lost, stolen or damaged property. It does not specify any one method to value any one piece of property, only that the method which most accurately represents the true cash value of the property should be used. The broad evidence rule means that all facts and circumstances that bear on the value of property can be considered.","The broad evidence rule is used by insurance companies to determine the dollar amount to be paid out to the insured in the event of a claim. As opposed to using the traditional actual cash value approach of replacement cost minus depreciation, the broad evidence rule can take into account many factors, including market value, original cost, replacement cost, age and condition of the property, location, frequency of use, durability of the item, assessed value, number of users in the household or business, offers to sell, offers to purchase, and rarity. Because of this, each actual cash value determination must be assessed on a claim-by-claim basis."

224,Buffer Layer,"The buffer layer is the amount that the insured is responsible for between their primary policy and an ancillary policy. Usually this amount refers specifically to the liability coverage, but it can reference all claims.","The buffer layer refers to the amount of risk that the insured party remains exposed to, even while holdingmultiple insurance policies. Insurance companies have begun writing policies with lower coverages due to changes in the insurance market.In response to insurers being less willing to extend primary policies to the upper limits,excessive claims and payouts have created an environment where multiple policies are becoming more common."

232,Bureau Rate,"Bureau rate refers to a standardized per-unit price for insurance published by a state insurance bureau. Traditionally, the rate was calculated by each bureau after collecting and analyzing rate data submitted by member insurance carriers in each state. Carriers were not required to adhere to these dates, but they could be instructive to companies and consumers. Bureau rate is a somewhat obsolete term; the rate has been replaced by industry-wide loss data published by each state to assist carriers in setting future rates. The rate data continues to be required among a long list of financial reports by each state for regulatory approval.","The bureau rate is one of many services historically provided by state insurance bureaus. It is also known as the manual rate, a reference to periodic manuals published by state regulators. Since then, both regulatory filings by insurance companies and publishing of industry data by states have largely moved to electronic formats. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed an electronic data collection platform known as the System for Electronic Rates and Form Filing (SERFF)."

Some items appearing on a CLUE report can both positively or negatively affect the rating. For example, a roof replaced due to hail damage can adversely affect a rating because the claim serves as an indicator of an insurer's future liability. On the positive side, a new roof lessens the risk associated with underwriting insurance on the home. Whether the positive benefit supersedes or offsets the negative depends on the insurer."

The Cape Cod (CC) method operates under the assumption that premiums or other volume measures are known for historical accident years, and that ultimate loss ratios are identical for all accident years. The Cape Cod method is sometimes called the Stanard-Buhlmann method.","The Cape Cod method is based off of the framework created by the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method of loss development, which also serves as the framework for the chain-ladder method and additive method. The primary difference between the Cape Cod and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods is that the Cape Cod method creates ultimate loss estimates using both internal and external information."
260,Capital At Risk (CaR),"Capital at risk (CaR) is the amount of capital that is set aside to coverrisks. CaRapplies to the self-insured, as well as insurance companies that underwrite insurance policies. It is used to pay losses. Similarly,an investor is required to have capital at risk in an investment in order to get certain tax treatments.","Insurance companies collect premiums for the policies that they underwrite. The amount of premium is determined based on the risk profile of the policyholder, the type of risk being covered, and the likelihood that a loss will be incurred after providing coverage. The insurance company uses this premium to fund its operations, as well as to earn investment income."
261,Capital Injection,"Capital injection is an investment of capital into a company or institution, generally in the form of cash, equity, and debt. The word ""injection"" connotes that the company or organization getting capital may be in financial distress, although it is not uncommon for the term to also refer to investments made in a startup or a new company.","Capital injections in the private sector are usually in exchange for an equity stake in the company that is receiving the funds. Capital injections can occur throughout the life cycle of a business. For example, at the establishment of a firm, it may open a seed round of cash investments from friends, family, and hand-selected angel investors. In return, the investors receive a portion of the company's ownership. If a private company in a growth phase wants to fund its momentum further, it canopen a series-A investment round, or it can take out debt, both of which are capital injections. If a mature company decides to go public, the money it earns through the issuance of shares is also a capital injection."
262,Capital Stock Insurance Companies,"A capital stock insurance company is a company that gets its capital from stockholdercontributions,in addition to its surplusand reserve accounts. In other words, a capital stock insurance company is one that gets a majority of its assets or money from the sale of shares or stock to stockholders.","All property andcasualtyinsurersperform the same basic function; however, some are organized as capital stock insurance companies while others operate as mutual companies. There are key differences between the two types of organizations. Each has advantages and disadvantages for insurance buyers."
263,Capitated Contract ,"A capitated contract is ahealthcare plan that allows payment of a flat fee for each patient it covers. Under a capitatedcontract, an HMO or managed care organization pays a fixed amount of money for its members to the health care provider. Capitatedcontractsare also referred to ascapitation agreements, capitation contracts and managed care capitated contracts.","Within a capitated contract, the healthcare provider is paid a set dollar amount per month to see patients regardless of how many treatments or the number of times the physician or clinic sees the patient. The agreement is that the provider will get a flat, prearranged payment in advance per month. Whether or not the patient needs services ina particular month, the provider will still get paid the same fee. The more treatment a patient needs, the less money a health provider makes per treatment."
264,Capitation Payments,"Capitation payments are paymentsagreed upon in a capitatedcontract by a health insurance company and a medical provider. They arefixed, pre-arranged monthly payments received by a physician, clinic or hospital per patient enrolled in a health plan, or per capita. Monthly payment is calculated one year in advance and remains fixed for that year, regardless of how often the patient needs services.","Capitation payments are defined, periodic, per-patient payments (usually monthly) for each individual enrolled in a capitated insurance plan. For example, a provider could be paid per-month, per-patient, despite how many times the patient comes in for treatment or how many services needed. The payment varies, depending on the capitation agreement, but generally they are based on characteristicssuch as the age of the individual enrolled in the plan. Modifying the plan, according to specific characteristics for groups of patients, is one way to compensate providers for the medical care expected for similar ailments within a group."
265,Captive Agent,"A captive agent is an insurance agent who only works for one insurance company. A captive agent is paid by that one company, either with a combination of salary and commissions or with just commissions. He or she may be a full-time employee or an independent contractor. Captive agents have in-depth knowledge of their particular company's insurance products, but cannot help a client who does not need or does not qualify for that company's products. The parent company may push its captive agents to sell certain policies or meet certain sales quotas.",
266,Captive Insurance Company,A captive insurance company is a wholly owned subsidiary company that provides risk-mitigation services for its parent company or a group of related companies. A captive insurance company may form if the parent company cannot find an outside firm to insurethem against particular business risks; if the premiums paid to the captive insurer creates tax savings; or if the insurance provided is more affordable or offers better coverage for the parent company's risks.,"Acaptive insurance company is a form of corporate ""self-insurance."" While there are financial benefits of creating a separate entity to provide insurance services, parent companies must consider the associated administrative and overhead costs, such as additional personnel. There are also complex compliance issues to consider. As a result, larger corporations predominantly form captive insurance companies."
267,Captive Value Added (CVA),Captive value-added refers to the financial benefits an organization could realize by creating a captive insurance company owned and operated by the parent organization.,"Captive value-added occurs when an organizations captive insurance subsidiary generates profits for the controlling organization. A primary purpose in creating a captive insurance company is to insure the risks of the owners, while benefiting the parent organization from the captive insurers underwriting profits."
268,"Care, Custody Or Control (CCC)","Care, custody and control is an exclusion found in liability insurance policies that removes indemnification for the insured when a property is placed in the care of the insured. The care, custody,or control (CCC) exclusion generally applies to property that is not owned by the insured, such as rental equipment or goods being transported.","Commercial general liability policies often contain a number of exclusions. Coverage typically applies to property that is owned by the insured party, or otherwise specifically listed in the insurance policy language. Other property, such as rented property, is often left uncovered by care, custodyor control exclusions."
269,Carmack Amendment,"The Carmack Amendment is a revision to the to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1877, which regulates the relationship between shipping companies and the owners of goods under shipment. The Carmack Amendment limits liabilities of these shipping companies, known as carriers, to loss or damage of the property itself. The Carmack Amendment, sometimes only referred to as Carmack, was enacted in 1906, and applies to insurance coverage for cargo.","Before the Carmack Amendment, companies involved in the transportation of goods across state borders were subject to state laws regulating the liabilities of shipping companies to their clients. The Carmack Amendment was an important step in the harmonization regulations applied to interstate shippers and interstate carriersfrom claims made by companies in excess of the value of the goods."
270,Carryover Provision,A carryover provision is an insurance policy clause that allows the policyholder to move claims from the end of one year to the beginning of the next year. Usually this provision only applies to losses sustained in the last three months of the year.,"Carryover provisions are commonly found in health insurance and related healthcare plans, and can be found inFlexible Spending Accounts (FSA) as well. The insured can benefit from having a carryover provision on apolicy if the policyholder incursa high number of claims in one year and have already met their deductible. This allows the policyholderto move additional claims that would have had no effect on this years deductible to next year to offset additional out of pocket costs. Carryover provisionsare most commonly found on employee-sponsored plans, but can sometimes be optioned on individual plans as well. However, the cost of the additional rider may prove to be too much for individuals to carry on their own."
271,Case Management,"Case management is the planning, processing and monitoring the healthcare services given to a patient by a coordinated group of healthcare providers. Case management is designed to provide for a patients needs while controllingcosts, with a case manager maintaining information on a patients outcomes. Insurance companies, hospitals, and outpatient care providers may all assign a case manager to monitor a particular patient.","A medical professional managing an individuals needs is not that different from a financial advisor managing a clients portfolio. Case managers evaluate a patients needs, and determine how to provide care efficiently given the resources at hand. Because case managers work for health insurance companies, hospitals, and other providers, they attempt to keep costs down as much as possible."
272,Cash Accumulation Method,Cash accumulation method refers to a common technique for comparing different cash value life insurance policies. It assumes that the death benefits for the policies are equal and unchanging. The aggregate difference between the premiums paid into the two policies is then evaluated over time.,"The cash accumulation method is used to rank policies according to their cost effectiveness. When comparing policies using this method, the one that has the most cash value at the end of the trial period is considered the better policy. This comparison requires that the premiums paid for each policy during the comparison period are equal. If they are not equal, then the difference between the two must be set aside, in order to make an apples-to-apples comparison."
273,Cash Flow Underwriting,Insurance companies may use cash flow underwriting as a pricing strategy when they price an insurance product below the rate of premium required to assume the cost of expected losses. The purpose of this strategy is to generate substantial investment capital from the increased business which comes from the lower pricing. Cash flow underwriting is a risky pricing strategy. ," Cash flow underwriting is a more common tactic in a softmarket when a weak economy makes potential insurance customers price sensitive. To stand out from the market competitionan insurance company may lower their premiums. However, at a particular point, thepremium will no longer cover the anticipated risk of underwriting the policy."
274,Cash Surrender Value,"The cash surrender value is the sum of money an insurance company pays to a policyholder or an annuity contract owner in the event that his or her policy is voluntarily terminated before its maturity or an insured event occurs. This cash value is the savings component of most permanent lifeinsurance policies, particularly whole life insurance policies. It is also known as ""cash value,"" ""surrender value,""and ""policyholder's equity.""","Cash surrender value applies to the savings element of whole life insurance policies payable before death. However, during the early years of a whole life insurance policy, the savings portion brings very little return compared to the premiums paid. Cash surrender value is the accumulated portion of a permanent life insurance policy's cash value that is available to the policyholder upon surrender of the policy. Depending on the age of the policy, the cash surrender value could be less than the actual cash value. In the early years of a policy, life insurance companies can deduct fees upon cash surrender. Depending on the type of policy, the cash value is available to the policyholder during his lifetime. It is important to note that surrendering a portion of the cash value reduces the death benefit."
275,Cash Value Accumulation Test (CVAT),Cash value accumulation test (CVAT) is a test for determining whether a financial product can be taxed as an insurance contract rather thanan investment.The cash value accumulation testis used to make sure that the cash value of the insurance policy does not exceed the present value of all future premium payments on the policy.,"Being able to pass the cash value accumulation test (CVAT) is incredibly important to a policyholder as well as the insurer. If an insurance product fails to pass, it is no longer considered an insurance productand is thus taxed like an investment. Insurance policies are able to grow in value on a tax-deferred basis, with death benefits being exempt from income tax. Most other investments are taxed as ordinary income, meaning that failing to pass the test will lead to a higher tax rate."
276,Cash Value Life Insurance,"Cash value life insurance is permanent life insurance with a cash value savings component. The policyholder can use the cash value for many purposes, such as a source of loans, as a source of cash, or to pay policy premiums.",
277,Casualty And Theft Losses,"Casualty and theft losses are deductiblelosses that arisefrom thedestruction or loss of a taxpayer's personal property. To be deductible, casualty losses must result from a sudden and unforeseen event. Theft losses generally require proof that the property was actually stolen and not just lost or missing.","Casualty and theft loss deductionsare only allowed by the Internal Revenue Servicefor one-off events that are out of the ordinaryand not a routine part of everyday life. The event also must be something that a person wasnot engaged with when it occurred. Natural disasters would qualify, including earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanesand storms. Even though a loss may have been sustainedby a natural cause, a loss cannot be claimed for something that occurred over time. An example of this would be property erosion, because the process is gradual."
278,Casualty Insurance,"Casualty insurance is a broad category of coverage against loss of property, damage or other liabilities. Casualty insurance includes vehicle insurance, liability insurance, theft insurance and elevator insurance.","An important type of casualty insurance for businesses is workers' compensation insurance, which protects a company from liabilities that arise when a worker is injured on the job. Another important typeof casualty insurance isliability insurance.Liability lossesare losses that occur as a result of the insureds interactions with others or their property.For homeowners or car owners, it's important to have casualty insurance as damage can end up being a large expense."
279,Cat Spread,"A cat spread is a type of derivative traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) that takes the form of an option on a catastrophe futures contract. In other words, a cat spread is basically a call option spread bought by insurance companies on catastrophe futures contracts. Purchasing a cat spread involves buying or selling a call option whose underlying asset is a catastrophe contract, while simultaneously selling or buying the same number of call options at a higher strike price. A cat spread is used by insurance companies to hedge risk coverage of catastrophic events.","Consider aninsurance company that buys a cat spread on a catastrophe futures contract with an expectation that the loss ratio on catastrophic events will fall within the range of 20to 40 percent. If losses fall within that range, the insurance company would exercise the option and sell the contract, enabling the company to make a profit which will be used to offset the losses. However, if the loss ratio does not fall within the 20to 40 percentrange, the option will expire at zero and the only thing the company has to lose is the original investment."
280,Catastrophe Accumulation,Catastrophe accumulation is a term used in the insurance industry that refers to the losses that an an insurer or reinsurer may face across a geographic area from a natural disaster.,"Catastrophe accumulation is calculated from a wide range of losses and involves partial loss to total loss across a potentially large number of policies. Normally, insurers and reinsurers absorb individual losses from claims relatively easily. The loss severity is typically low compared to the total value of all premiums. A natural disaster, however, can result in losses far exceeding total premiums. Because natural disasters are rare, it is easy for insurers and reinsurers to underestimate the losses that can occur, and thus require from the insured a lower premium than the risk actually warrants."
281,Catastrophe Equity Put (CatEPut),"A catastrophe equity put (CatEPut) is an option purchased by an insurer allowing it to sell its own stock at a certain price in the event insurance losses pass a specific threshold. In the event of a catastrophic event, CatEPuts can help insurance companies cover their increased claims.","Insurers plan on a certain number of claims to be made over the course of the year, and set aside money to ensure they can pay those claims. In some cases, so many claims are filed that the insurer may not have sufficient funds to cover its claims obligations. For example, in a year where several catastrophic hurricanes bring devastating flooding to the United States, an insurer that underwrites homeowners policies could face bankruptcy."
282,Catastrophe Excess Reinsurance,Catastrophe excess reinsurance protects catastrophe insurers from financial ruin in the event of a large-scale natural disaster.,"Catastrophe excess reinsurance protects insurance companies from the financial risks involved in large-scale catastrophic events. The size and unpredictability of catastrophes force insurers take on a tremendous amount of risk. Although catastrophic events happen infrequently, when they do happen they tend to cover wide geographic areas and cause large amounts of damage. When an insurer encounters a large number of claims all at once, the losses potentially could cause it to restrict new business or cause it to refuse to renew existing policies, limiting its ability to recover."
283,Catastrophe Futures,"Catastrophe futures are futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). These futures contracts are used by insurance companies to protect themselves against future catastrophe losses. The value of a catastophe futures contract is equal to $25,000 multiplied by the catastrophe ratio for the quarter. The catastrophe ratio is a numerical value provided by the CBOT every quarter.","Catastrophe futures started trading on the Chicago Board of Trading (CBOT) in 1992. The value of a catastrophe future contracts increase when catastrophe losses are high and decrease when catastrophe losses are low. In the event of a catastrophe, if losses are high, the value of the contract goes up and the insurer makes a gain that hopefully offsets whatever losses that might be incurred. The reverse is also true. If catastrophe losses are lower than expected, the value of the contract decreases and the insurer (buyer) loses money."
284,Catastrophe Insurance,"Catastrophe insuranceprotects businesses and residences against natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and against man-made disasters such as terrorist attacks. These low-probability, high-cost events are generally excluded from standard hazard insurance policies, which makescatastrophe insurance necessary.","Catastrophe insurance is different from other types of insurance in that it is difficult to estimate the total potential cost of an insured loss, and a catastrophic event results in an extremely large number of claims being filed at the same time. This makes it difficult for catastrophe insurance issuers to effectively manage risk. Reinsurance and retrocession are used along with catastrophe insurance to manage catastrophe risk."
285,Catastrophe Loss Index - CLI,"Catastrophe Loss Index - CLI, is anindex used in the insurance industry to quantify the magnitude of insurance claims expected from major disasters. They are created by third-party firms that research natural disasters and work to provide estimates of the amount of losses from each catastrophe. The catastrophe loss index (CLI) is often used by insurance companies to supplement, or check their internal efforts to estimate the company's expected claims from each catastrophe.","These indexes help with setting aside reserves for potential claims, as well as determining where or when to send out insurance adjusters to verify insurance claims. CLIs are also used as the underlying basis for a variety of derivative securities and catastrophe bonds. Securitization of catastrophic loss risks allows insurance companies to hedge against disasters, such as hurricanes, which might otherwise threaten to deplete an insurance company's reserves."
286,Catastrophe Reinsurance,Catastrophe reinsurance is purchased by an insurance company to reduce its exposure to the financial risks associated with a catastrophic event occurring.Catastrophe reinsurance allows the insurer to shift some or all of the risk associated with policies that it underwrites in exchange for a portion of the premiums that it receives from policyholders.,"Catastrophes are extremely rareevents, so buying catastrophe reinsurance is usually a carefully considered decision for an insurance company. Catastrophes arevery unlikely to occur with frequency, but when they do, the amount of damages they cause can be mind-boggling. Without reinsurance, claims made after a catastrophe would come from the insurers operating cash flow, from debt financing, or from liquidating assets. Insurers have to balance being prepared for a low probability event and taking on premiums from issuing policies that may result in claims."
287,Catastrophic Health Insurance,"Catastrophic health insurance is Affordable Care Act-compliant medical coverage open to people under 30 and adults of any age who have a government-approved general hardship exemption. Catastrophic health insurance has lower premiums than most metal-level marketplace plans, but the highest possible deductible and out-of-pocket maximum. It makes sense for some people who have little to spend on monthly premiums, but who dont want to go without health insurance.","Catastrophic health insurance was first introduced by Senator Abraham Ribicoff in October 1973 when he proposed a bipartisan bill for catastrophic health insurance coverage. Thecoverage was meant to befor workers who were financed by payroll taxes and for Medicarebeneficiaries. Now, catastrophic health insurance availability varies by state, with some states having no plans, some having few plans and some having several options to choose from. Catastrophic plans can be PPO or HMOs, and premiums vary by insurance company and location. If you buy this type of plan, you wont be able to take advantage of any health insurance premium tax credits you might be eligible for based on your income, which means that some consumers can get better coverage at lower cost by choosing a bronze plan and using the subsidies. Is Catastrophic Health Insurance Right for You? will walk you through the decision process."
288,Catastrophic Illness Insurance,Catastrophic illness insurance is a type of coverage which protects the insured for a specific and severe health problem over the defined period. Itdiffers from other forms of health insurance in that there is limited coverage to the specifically named risk. An individual can buy the coverage as a stand-alone policy or as a rider to life insurance.,This insurance is also known as critical illness and critical care insurance. 
289,Ceded Reinsurance Leverage,"Ceded Reinsurance Leverage is the ratio of ceded insurance balances to policyholders surplus. Ceded reinsurance leverage represents the extent to which an insurance company relies on ceding risk to reinsurers. This includes ceded premiums, net balances for unpaid losses and unearned premiums.","Companies use reinsurance as a way to shift risk off of their portfolios, which they do in exchange for a portion of the premiums they earn from writing policies. Ceding risk to reinsurers is a fairly common occurrence in the industry, as it allows insurance companies to reduce their exposure to a potential surge in claims by shifting some of the obligation to another company."
290,Cedent,"A cedent is aparty inan insurance contract who passes financial obligation for certain potential losses to the insurer. In return for bearing a particular risk of loss, the cedent pays an insurance premium. The term cedent is most often used in the reinsurance industry, although the term could apply to any insured party.","Insurance firms are vulnerable to unforeseen losses due to excessive exposure to high risk entities. A reinsurer provides the cedentcompany withmultiple reductions inliability and protection against big losses. The transmission of all or some risks to the reinsurance company helps the cedentcompanymaintainits solvency margin whileenhancingunderwriting capacity by reducing the associated costs, etc."
291,Ceding Commission,"A fee paid by a reinsurance company to the ceding company to cover administrative costs and acquisition expenses. Ceding commission is most commonly found in pro rata or quota share reinsurance treaties, and may be calculated as a percentage of the reinsurance companys premium rather than a flat amount.","Insurance companies looking to reduce their risk exposure through the use of a reinsurance contract have several types of agreements to choose from. In a proportional treaty, the insurance company agrees to exchange a portion of the risk (and potential loss) associated with the policies that it underwrites with the reinsurer in exchange for a portion of the premiums. In the case of a quota share agreement, the insurance company cedes a percentage of its premium to the reinsurer. To cover the difference between the underwriting expenses that the insurance company has and the portion of premiums that it has ceded to the reinsurer that should have covered those expenses, the reinsurer pays the ceding company a ceding commission."
292,Ceding Company,A ceding companyis aninsurance company that passes the part or all of its risks from its insurance policy portfolio to a reinsurance firm. Passing off risk in this manner allows the ceding company to hedge against undesired exposure to loss and frees up capital to use in writing new insurance contracts.,"The ceding company retains liability for the reinsured policies, so although claims should be reimbursed by the reinsurance firm, if the reinsurance company defaults, the ceding company may still have to make a payout on reinsured policy risks.Insurance is a highly regulated industry which requires insurance companies to write certain semi-standardized policies and maintain sufficient capital as collateral against losses. Insurance companies can use reinsurance to allow them more freedom in controlling their operations. For instance, in cases where the insurance company does not wish to carry the risk of certain losses in a standard policy, these risks can be reinsured away. An insurer can also use reinsurance to control the amount of capital it is required to hold as collateral."
293,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is the agencywithin the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)that administers the nations major health care programs. Health care programs include Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),and the state and federal health insurance marketplaces. CMS collects and analyzes data, produces research reports, and works to eliminate instances of fraud and abuse within the health care system.","Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesmanages many crucial national health care programs that affect the lives of millions of Americans.The agencys goal is to providea high-quality health care system thatensuresbetter care, access to coverage, and improved health. CMS has offices at its headquarters in Maryland and in several cities throughout the United States, including Boston, Kansas City, San Francisco and Atlanta, strategically positioned to serve each region."
294,Central Guarantee Fund,"A fund set aside by state insurance regulators to pay out claims to policyholders in the event an insurance company becomes insolvent. The central guarantee funds are accumulated from regular assessments charged to operating insurance companies. When an insurance company is declared insolvent by the state courts, regulators recover the company's remaining assets into the central guarantee fund. Remaining policyholder claims are then paid out of the fund. ","The individual consumer is ill equipped to assess the solvency of an insurance company. The use of a central guarantee fund by some state insurance regulators gives consumers piece of mind that their claims will be honored even if their insurer goes bankrupt. State insurance regulators enforce strict collateral requirements meant to ensure prudence, keep insurers solvent and limit the need for payouts from the guarantee fund. "
295,Central Loss Fund,"Central Loss fund is set aside by some states in order to cover policyholder claims if an insurance company is declared insolvent. A central loss fund is created by state insurance regulators through the collection of assessments on insurance companies operating in the state. Most states have a central loss fund of some type, however the details of their operations differ according to their respective state laws.","A central loss fund is important to protect the interests of policyholders in the event an insurance company is unable to pay claims. The states' respective insurance commissioners are responsible for overseeing insurance companies and ensuring that they maintain adequate collateral to cover expected losses. However,unanticipated catastrophes or mismanagement may arise which result in claims exceeded an insurance company's ability to pay."
296,Central Provident Fund - CPF,The Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a mandatory benefits account providing retirement earnings and healthcare for Singaporeans. Contributions to the retirement account originate from both the employee and the employer.,"The Central Provident Fund (CPF) started in 1955 as a way to assure all Singaporeans would have income and financial stability in retirement. CPF was controversial when first introduced with considerable opposition to the concept of a forced retirement program, but it became mostly popular over the years and has expanded to include healthcare and public housing assistance. Singaporeans can begin drawing from their retirement account at age 55, and similar to the Social Security system in the United States, waiting to take monies until older means more money will be in the account."
297,Certain And Continuous,"Certain and continuous is a type of annuity that guarantees a number of payments, even if the annuitant dies.If the annuitant passes away during the guaranteed period, a specified beneficiary will receive the rest of the payments. Alternatively, if the annuitant outlives the specified number of guaranteed payments, he or she would continue to receive income payments for life; however, no payments would be available to the beneficiary.","Also called C&C annuity, certain and continuous annuities are a type of guaranteed annuity where the annuity issuer is required to make payments for at least a specified number of year. A common example is a 10-year certain and continuous annuity. In such a situation, monthly payments are paid to the annuitant for life. If theannuitant dies, the designated beneficiary would receive any monthly payments for the remainder of the certain period –in this case, 10 years.Otherwise, if the annuitant lives beyond the 10-year period, he or she will continue to receive monthly payments for life; however, after the 10-year period, the beneficiary would no longer be eligible for monthly payments."
298,Certificate Of Insurance ,"A certificate of insurance (COI) is a non-negotiable document issued by an insurance company or broker verifying the existence of an insurance policy and summarizing key aspects and conditions of the policy. For example, a standard certificate of insurance lists the policyholder's name, policy effective date, the type of coverage, policy limits, as well as other important details of the policy.","Situations, where liability and significant losses are of concern, require a certificate of insurance. Small-business owners and contractors often have a certificate of insurance granting protection against liability for workplace accidents or injuries. The purchase of liabilityinsurance will usually trigger the issuanceof a COI."
299,Certificate Of Need,A Certificate of Need (CON) is an endorsement that numerous states require before approving the construction of a new health-care facility. The central idea of CON legislation is the assertion that overbuilding and redundancy in health-care facilities leads to higher health-care costs.,"Certificate of Need (CON)programsare aimed at ensuring that a new hospital or nursing home is necessary, and they require state authorities to determine whether the local demand is sufficient to allow for the new construction."
300,Cession,Cession refers to the portions of the obligations in an insurance company's policy portfolio that are transferred to a reinsurer. Risk can be transferred to the reinsurer in one of two ways: proportional or non-proportional. Proportional reinsurance is an arrangement where the insurer and reinsurer share an agreed percentage of both premiums and losses. Non-Proportional reinsurance is a system by which the reinsurer pays only when losses are over an agreed-upon amount.,"The reinsurance industry has become increasingly sophisticated due to competition within the insurance industry. Reinsurance creates an opportunity for insurer and reinsurers to profit at each others' expense, based on the accuracy of the actuarial calculations, which price the risk incurred. For example, suppose a reinsurer believes the risk of loss on a certain coverage is less than is actually the case. If an insurer has a more accurate risk model, he can recognize that a reinsurer is undercharging for this coverage. In this case, the insurer simply sells the policies to customers at the higher rate and buys reinsurance at the lower rate, locking in an arbitrage profit."
301,Cestui Que Vie,"Cestui que vie is French for he who lives. Itis a legal term for an individual who is thebeneficiaryof a trust or insurance policy, with rightsto property and the income and profits that the property provides.","Cestui que vie as a legal concept dates to the medieval period, specifically England. During this time, the owners of farms and other properties could be absent for extended periods of time as they traveled, whether for business or religious purposes. It became important to ensure that family members, business partners or tenants could use the property without fear of it being expropriated by feudal lords. While the individual was away, a trustee took care of the land, but did not retain legal ownership over the property. The trust often relied on a good faith understanding between the parties."
302,Chain Ladder Method (CLM),The Chain Ladder Method (CLR) is amethod for calculating the claims reserve requirement in an insurance companys financial statement. The chain ladder method (CLM) is used by insurers to forecast the amount of reserves that must be established in order to cover future claims. This actuarial method is one of the most popular reservemethods.,"The chain ladder method calculates incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss estimates, using run-off triangles of paid losses and incurred losses, representing the sum of paid losses and case reserves.Insurance companies are required to set aside a portion of the premiums they receive from their underwriting activities to pay for claims that may be filed in the future. The amount of claimsforecasted, along with the amount of claims that are actually paid, determine how much profit the insurer will publish in its financial documents."
303,Chain Of Title,"Chain of title is the official ownership record of a property or asset. Chain of ownership gets its name from its sequential nature; a chain of title traces historical title transfers from the current owner back to the original owner. Due to their critical importance in establishing ownership of a property or asset, rigorous and accurate title records are generally maintained by a centralized registry or system.","Chain of title has considerable significance in real estate. In a real estate transaction, the chain of title is researched on behalf of the buyer by a title company, which summarizes all title transfers and encumbrances in a title report. Title insurance is used by buyers to protect against financial loss ensuing from errors in the title report."
304,Channeling,"Channeling is a commercial insurance policy which insures employees and affiliated personnel under one policy, rather than requiring them to each have their own policy.","Channeling is most commonly associated with hospitals and medical facilities, which insure their doctors and medical staff under a general liability policy.Physicians, nurses, and the medical staff working at a hospital stand the risk of one day being named in a lawsuit, such as a medical malpractice lawsuit. These lawsuits can be expensive to defend against, which is why medical professionals often purchase professional liability insurance to retain coverage. When a doctor and the hospital are under separate policies, the claimant may name both the doctor and the hospital in the suit. This can create a situation in which the hospital seeks to push blame on the doctor in order to reduce its risk exposure, which can lead to an adversarial relationship once the claim is settled."
305,Chaplain Malpractice Insurance,"Chaplain malpractice insurance is liability insurance that provides coverage for chaplains, priests, and other clergy members. Chaplain malpractice insurance, also called priest malpractice insurance, more generally covers claims made against a professional for counseling services that a clergy member may provide.","Chaplain malpractice insurance protects against claims of malpractice caused during counseling activities. While not considered to be in the same professional field as a therapist or psychologist, chaplains and other members of the clergy are often called upon to provide counseling services to members of their organizations. Counseling services may relate to marriage and family matters, but may also include other types of privileged exchanges of information between the clergy and other individuals and groups.For example, a chaplain may have provided counseling to a married couple that was trying to avoid divorce. If the couple ultimately goes through with the divorce, they may sue the chaplain for not providing the proper guidance that could have helped them avoid the legal expenses and mental anguish."
306,Charging Order,"A charging order is a court-authorized right granted to a judgment creditor to attach distributions made from a business entity, such as a limited partnership (LP) or limited liability company (LLC). The debtor will be a member, partner, or the owner of the business entity.","The charging order is usually limited to the dollar amount of the judgment and is similar to garnishment of wages or income. It does not give the creditor management rights in the business entity. Nor can the creditor interfere in the management of the business to which the debtor is a partner,member, or owner.​​​​​​​"
307,Charitable Gift Life Insurance,"Charitable gift life insurance is amethod of contributing to charity by taking out life insurance on yourself with the charity as a beneficiary. Using charitable gift life insurance may allow donors to amplify their giving power. Rather than giving large cash gifts as part of a will, some donors find it easier to simply pay the life insurance premiums.","Using charitable gift life insurance means the donor does not get a tax deduction for the premiums paid. However, the amount of the death benefit paid to the charity will be deductible for estate tax purposes. Charitable gift life insurance may also be less likely to cause probate disputes, since the intention to make the gift is clearly laid out by the insurance contract."
308,Charitable Split-Dollar Insurance Plan,"A charitable split-dollar insurance plan is a type of life-insurance arrangement in which a donor gifts money to a charitable organization so the organization may in turn invest that gift in a life insurance policy for the donor. When the donor dies, the benefits of the insurance policy go to the charity and to the donors heirs. The initial agreement between the donor and the charity should specify the specific breakdown of the split.","This type of life insurance arrangement originally gained popularity for its tax benefits. The charitable donation saved the donor from paying taxes on the charitable gift. Meanwhile, the donors heirs would be exempt from paying taxes on the money they inherited through the life insurance policy."
309,Chartered Insurance Professional (CIP),"A Chartered Insurance Professional (CIP) is a designationthe Insurance Institute of Canada grants to agents and other professionals in the property and casualty insurance industry. This certification recognizes expertise, knowledge and compliance with ethical standards. The Institute created this designation as a way for agents to demonstrate professional standing to both employers and clients.​​​​​​​","An applicant must meet several requirements to earn a designation as aChartered Insurance Professional (CIP).

It represents a thorough understanding of a broad array of personal risk management and life insurance planning issues and stresses ethics, professionalism, and in-depth knowledge in the delivery of financial advice."
311,Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter (CPCU),"Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter (CPCU), is a professional credential earned by individuals who specialize in risk management and property-casualty insurance. The Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter, also called CPCU, credential is most likely to be earned by insurance agents and brokers, insurance claims representatives, risk managers, and underwriters. It is offered by The Institutes.","To obtain the CPCU credential, an individual must pass a number of classes covering insurance and risk management topics.

313,Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP),"The Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides medical coverage for individuals under age 19 whose parents earn too much income to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to pay for private coverage. Congress passed CHIP in 1997 during the Clinton administration.","The Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a U.S. federal healthcare program administered and named differently by each state. For example, the state of New York State calls its program theChild Health Plus whileArkansas calls its program ARKids. Similar to the way Medicaid works, the federal government provides matching funds to each state. Responsibility for managing CHIP programs falls under the states Medicaid administration."
314,Civil Authority Clause,"A civil authority clause, also known as a public authority clause, is an insurance policy provision which outlines how the loss of business income coverage applies when a government entity denies access to the covered property.","One of the primary responsibilities of civil authorities (local, state, or federal governments) is protecting individuals and businesses, especially from catastrophes, such as hurricanes, wildfires, or floods. A civil authority clause also protects an insured from damages caused by firefighters and police officers when dealing with a situation on a property."
315,Civil Commotion,"A civil commotion is a public gathering of a large number of people that results in property damage. Civil commotion generally refers to a revolt or riot by a large number of people that occurs in a public space. Typically, some participants in the uprising seek to harm others or create other mayhem.","Most insurers include losses caused by civil commotion, although some exclude it from insurance coverage. Moreover, some insurance providers offer specialized coverage for this type of peril."
316,Claims Adjuster ,"A claims adjusterinvestigates insurance claims to determine the extent of the insuring company's liability. Claims adjusters may handle property claims involving damage to structures, and/or liability claims involving personal injuries or third-person property damage. A claims adjuster reviews each case by speaking with the claimant, interviewing any witnesses, researching records (such as police or medical records) and inspecting any involved property.","Claims adjusters verify insuranceclaims anddetermine a fair amount for settlement. These can be any type of claim, from personal injury to property damage. In property damage claims, the main role of the insurance adjuster is to carry out a detailed investigation into the claim by:"
317,Claims Reserve,"A claims reserve is the money that is earmarked for the eventual claim payment. The claims reserve funds are set aside for the future payment of incurred claims that have not been settled and, thus, represent a balance sheet liability.",The claims reserve is also known as the balance sheet reserve.
318,Claims-Made Multiplier,A factor that is used to determine the premium of a claims-made policy. Claims-made multipliers are used to determine how much credit the insured receives over a specific period in a multi-year contract. Rates in claims-made policies are modified by factors that depend on the number of years that the policyholder has had the policy.,"Insurance companies primarily use one of two methods for determining when coverage is triggered for one of their policies. An occurrence policy will have its coverage triggered on the date the loss event occurred, and does not provide coverage for events that took place before the policy came into effect. The insurer will be responsible for settling a claim even if the claim is made years after the loss event occurred. This type of policy is used in general commercial liability, auto, and homeowners policies."
319,Claims-Made Policy,"Claims-made policy refers to an insurance policy that provides coverage when a claim is made against the policy, regardless of when the claim event took place. A claims-made policy is most likely to be purchased when there is a delay between when claims occur and when they are filed. Business insurance policies are often offered as either a claims-made policy or an occurrence policy. While the claims-made policy provides coverage for claims when the event is reported, the occurrence policy provides coverage when the event occurs.","A claims-made policy is a type of insurance policy most commonly used to cover the risks associated with business operations. For example, these policies are often used to cover the potential for mistakes associated with errors and omissions(E&O) in financial statements. They are also used to cover businesses from claims made by employees, including wrongful termination, sexual harassment, and discrimination claims."
320,Clash Reinsurance,Clash reinsurance is an additional type of extended reinsurance coverage which protects a primary or ceding insurance company. An insurance company will need clash coverage in the eventone casualty loss event results in two or more claims to the primary insurer from insured policyholders. Primary insurance companies purchase clash reinsurance for their security. It reduces the maximum potential loss on either a single risk or a large number of risks. Clash reinsurance may apply to natural events or financial and corporate disasters.​​​​​​​,"Clash reinsurance extends the coverage from normal reinsurance recoveries when an insurance company faces two or more claims from multiple insured policyholders following a catastrophic event, such as a hurricane, flood, fire or earthquake.Clash insuranceis intended to protect the insurer when numerous claims arise from an out-of-the-ordinary event. Clash coverage allows an insurance company to share substantial risks, and the accompanying substantial loss, with other companies."
321,Class 1 Insurance,"Class 1 insurance covers an individual occupying an owned vehicle, an individual occupying a vehicle owned by a resident relative, a pedestrian, or a bicyclist. Class 1 insurance, also written as Class I insurance, provides benefits to qualifying parties for any insurance policy in which premiums are paid.","Class 1 insurance covers a narrow group of people. In addition to covering the named insured, the policy will also cover spouses and relatives that the insured shares a residence with. The difference between Class 1 insurance and Class 2 insurance is that Class 2 insurance extends coverage to individuals who may not be resident relatives of the policyholder, but who may have permission to use or occupy the insured vehicle. Class 1 insurance is thus a more narrow coverage because it applies to a smaller subset of people."
322,Class 2 Insurance,"Class 2 insurance covers individuals that are not specifically named in an auto insurance policy. Class 2 insurance, also often written as Class II insurance coverage, applies to uninsured motorists. Class 1 insurance covers an individual occupying an owned vehicle, an individual occupying a vehicle owned by a resident relative, a pedestrian or a bicyclist.","Class 2 insurance coverage applies to individuals who do not fall under the Class 1 coverage restrictions, meaning that Class 2 insurance applies to individuals who are not the policy owner, not the spouse of the policy owneror not a resident relative of the policy owner. Resident relatives include individuals, typically immediate family members, who share a residence with the insured. For example, a Class 2 insured individual could be a friend of the policy owner. The coverage applies as long as the Class 2 individual is traveling in a vehicle identified in the insurance policy."
323,Classified Insurance,"Classified insurance is coverage provided to a policyholder that is considered more risky and thusless desirable to the insurer. Classified insurance, also known as substandard insurance, is most commonly associated with health insurance and life insurance.","Insurance companies often underwrite policies for a variety of different risk classes. In the case of life insurance, for example, the insurer may provide coverage to healthy individuals, considering this group a low risk because they are less likely to die - an event which results in a claim being made against the policy. As a result, the insurer is more likely to offer the policy to healthy individuals at a lower premium. On the other end of the risk spectrum, the insurer may provide coverage to less healthy individuals but charge a higher premium."
324,Clean Sheeting,Clean Sheeting is the fraudulent act of purchasing a life insurance policy without disclosing a pre-existing terminal illness or disease. This type of fraud is often done with both the knowledge of the purchaser and the agent involved.,"In cases of clean sheeting, the policy is often sold shortly after it is purchased in a viatical settlement, but the money received is a lot less than what a legitimate settlement would yield. This is because there is a higher chance that the fraudulent policy will be rescinded. This type of fraud provides huge gains for the person who buys out the purchaser because he or she is able to buy the policy at a large discount, somewhere around 10% of the policy's face value."
325,Cleanup Fund,"A cleanup fund is aninsurance term referring to the final expenses associated with an individual after his/her death. The cleanup fund, or funds for final expenses, is a type of life insurance policy intended to cover the deceased's final expenses. Costs associated with funeral expenses, cemetery or mausoleum fees, and the costs of settling financial and property issues may be covered.","A cleanup fund can be a standalone policy or written in conjunction with another type of life insurance policy. The cleanup fund provides the estate with a means of paying for certain expenses related to the death, including funeral expenses and the costs of settling the remaining estate."
326,Clear-Space Clause,"A clear-space clause is a passage in some property insurance policies that stipulates that a certain insured property, asset group or other item covered by an insurance policy must be a specified distance from any surrounding properties.","A clear-space clause is intended to limit liability by protecting surrounding structures and properties from potentially damaging or hazardous conditions. A home, building or other structure is much more likely to incur damage or loss if there are one or more other structures in close proximity. This increased risk is often considered by an insurance company, and even a lender, when evaluating potential risk through fire or a similar disaster. When a fire occurs in an area where properties are connected, semi-attached or in very close proximity, it is common for the fire to quickly spread from the originating source to adjoining properties, resulting in major damage or perhaps total destruction of numerous properties."
327,Close Corporation Plan,A close corporation plan is a form of business buy-sell agreement. Close corporation plans stipulate that the surviving partners must purchase all of the shares owned by the deceased partner or owner. The plan outlines the method of funding as well as the price at which the shares must be purchased.,"Close corporation plans are usually funded with life insurance policies. They usually take one of two basic forms. One is a cross-purchase agreement, where each partner owns a policy on all of the others, and the other is known as an stock redemption plan, where the corporation owns a single policy on each stockholder."
328,Closing,Closing is the final phase of mortgage loan processing where the property title passes from the seller to the buyer.,"A closing agent who usually is an attorney or official from a title or mortgage company oversees this process, which takes place at a title company or escrow office. The mortgage closing process varies from state to state. This process is called a closing because the escrow account used to complete the property buying process gets closed. During closing, also called settlement or account settlement, the participants review, authorize, and date numerous legal documents."
329,Clunker ,"A clunker is a popular reference to the old vehicle traded in under the U.S. government's ""cash-for-clunkers"" program, rolled out in 2009, for a newer more fuel efficient vehicle. For a ""clunker"" to be eligible for the program, it must have satisfied four conditions:",1) It has to be in drivable condition;2) It has to have been continuously insured for one year prior to the trade-in;3) It has to have been manufactured more than 25 years ago on the date of trade in;4) It has a combined fuel efficiency of 18 miles per gallon or less.
330,Co-Reinsurance,Co-reinsurance is the term used when multiple reinsurance company participateina reinsurance contract. Reinsurance companies may act together in this waytoensure that the amount of risk being taken over from the insurer can be covered. Companies may also participate in co-reinsurance for tax mitigation purposes.Co-reinsurance may exist in both facultative reinsurance and treaty reinsurance.,"Insurance companies work with reinsurance companies, or with other insurance companiesthat offer reinsurance,in order to reduce their risk exposure. This risk reduction is accomplishedby shifting some or all of the risk that the insurer has taken on by underwriting policies to the reinsurer, who in exchange for indemnifying the insurer is given some of the insurance premiums that the insurer collects."
331,Co-pay,"A co-pay is a fixed out-of-pocket amount paid by an insured for covered services. It is a standard part of many health insurance plans. Insurance providers often charge co-pays for services such as doctor visits or prescriptions drugs. Co-pays are a specified dollar amount rather than a percentage of the bill, and they usually paid at the time of service.","Co-pay fees vary among insurers but typically are $25 or less. For example, an insurance plan with co-pays may require the insured to pay $25 per doctor visit or $10 per prescription. Review the terms of your insurance plan to determine your co-pay option. If there is a co-pay option, it may include different fees for physician visits, emergency room visits, specialists' visits, and other medical services. Insurance providers often charge higher co-pays for appointments with out-of-network providers."
332,CoInsurance,"Coinsurance is the amount, generally expressed as a fixed percentage, an insured must pay against a claim after the deductible is satisfied. In health insurance, a coinsurance provision is similar to a co-payment provision, except co-pays require the insured to pay a set dollar amount at the time of the service.Some property insurance policies contain coinsurance provisions.",Coinsurance also applies to the level of property insurance that an owner must buyon a structure for the coverage of claims. 
333,Coastal Barrier Improvement (CBI) Act,"The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act is federal legislation enacted in 1990 in the United States to renew the 1982 Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA). Under the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act (CBIA), federal disaster relief and federal flood insurance are not available in high-risk, storm-prone coastal areas and barrier islands. A property constructed before the CBIA may still be eligible for federal disaster relief and federal flood insurance, but if it is substantially improved or damaged, these benefits will no longer be available.",
334,Coded Excess,"Coded Excess is a type of excess of loss reinsurance in which the reinsurer receives a portion of the premium for each risk that is adjusted to take into account the individual covered risks effect on the entire reinsurance contract. Coded excess, also referred to as coded excess of loss, has a more complex pricing structure than other forms of excess of loss insurance, but is considered to provide a more accurate pricing structure.","Excess of loss reinsurance protects the reinsurance company against the portion of loss in excess of a specified limit. The premium is not proportional to the coverage limit, which allows the reinsurer to limit its financial responsibility to the proportion of the loss relative to the limit."
335,Coincidental Excess Coverage,"Coincidental Excess Coverage provides excess coverage for a specified event or circumstance. Coincidental excess coverage will only apply under certain circumstances, and is a type of excess liability insurance.","In some cases, the insurance coverage provided by a primary insurance policy is deemed insufficient by the policyholder. In these circumstances, the policyholder may seek to have additional coverage provided under a conditional excess coverage provision."
336,Coinsurance Formula,The coinsurance formula is thehomeowners insurance formula that determines the amount of reimbursement that a homeowner will receive from a claim. The coinsurance formula becomes effective when a homeowner fails to keep coverage of at least 80 percentof the home's replacement value. Those in this situation who file a claim will only receive partial reimbursement according to the formula.,"The coinsurance formula itself is relatively simple. Begin by dividing the actual amount of coverage on the house by the amount that should have been carried (80% of the replacement value). Then multiply this amount by the amount of the loss, and this will give you the amount of the reimbursement.If this reimbursement value is greater then the specified limits of a single insurance company, a secondary coinsurer will supply the remaining funds."
337,Coinsurer,"A coinsurer is one of the parties that provides additional insurance to the same person or policy. This party provides partial coverage along with other coinsurers. They are generally used when the amount of the policy being written is too large for a single insurer to cover by itself. For example, after a fire, the primary insurance company will cover the majority of the schedule, while the coinsurer will be responsible for the rest.","In some instances, state or federal law may dictate that some risks must be jointly insured by several coinsurers in order to adequately diversify the risk of a possible large claim. Coinsurers will share in any claim or loss for the proportionate amount of risk that they take on."
338,Collateral Value Insurance,"Collateral Value Insurance is a type of business insurance used by lenders to guarantee the value of appraised property. This type of insurance also guarantees a minimum liquidation value in the event the property must be sold. In most cases, the property being used as collateral is appraised before a certificate of guarantee is issued.",A collateral value is the estimatedfair market valueof an asset that is being used as loan collateral. Collateral value is determined by appraisal from a qualified expert.Collateral value is often a key determinant in the terms associated with a secured loan. Secured loans are typically made for a specified loan to value amount with the collateral used to secure the loan in case of default.
339,Collection Commission,A collection commission is a term in the insurance industry that refers to the percentage of insurance policypremiums owed to an agent for selling the policy.,The collection commission is typically set as a percentage of the amount that is collected. The amount is still subject to a cap on the total amount of commission that can be paid for a particular time period or payment batch.
340,College Of Insurance,"College Of Insurance is one of several institutions of higher learning that teach courses related to specific aspects of insurance. The College of Insurance is a specialized institution that provides undergraduate and graduate degrees in insurance, actuarial science and financial services. The college is located in the financial district of lower Manhattan.","The College of Insurance was founded in New York in 1901. Its entire curriculum was taken over by St. John's University 100 years later and now comprises its school of Risk Management, Insurance and Actuarial Science under the The Peter J. Tobin College of Business. It consists of high-tech classrooms, computer labs and the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis library."
341,Collision Damage Waiver (CDW),"A collision damage waiver (CDW)is additional insurance coverage offered to an individual renting an automobile. A collision damage waiveris optional, with the cost of the waiver dependent on a variety of factors, including the type of rental car and where the car is being driven. The waiver typically covers losses from the theft of or damage to a rental car, but is unlikely to cover bodily injury caused by an accident.","Renters that purchase a collision damage waiver pay an additional daily fee on top of the rental car fee. The CDW provides a level of protection for the renter that covers damage to the rental car. If the car is damaged then the renter is not responsible for some or all repairs, as well as for any loss of use fees that may accrue while the rental car is being repaired."
342,Collision Insurance,"Collision insurance is auto coverage that reimburses the insured for damage sustained to their personal automobile, due to the fault of the insured driver. This type of insurance is often added as an extension of a basic policy.","As the name implies, Collision insurance repays the insured for damage from an actual collision. It does not cover damage due to theft or vandalism. It also does not cover damage that is paid from another driver's policy, if the other driver was at fault."
343,Combination Agency,"Combination agencyrefers to an insurance dealer that sells more than one class of insurance, or offers other financial services in addition to insurance. An agency can be independent of a particular insurer or dedicated to selling that company's policies.","A combination agency takes advantage of regulatory developments that emerged in the middle of the 20th century and allowed insurers to issue multiple types of insurance. In the first half of the century, state regulation of insurance companies tended to categorize carriers in one of three major sectors. The first group issued life insurance and annuity products. The second group included casualty and surety insurers, whose policies covered such areas as burglary, equipment, property damage and personal liability. The final category was known as fire and marine insurers, issuing policies on water damage, fire, motor and marine vehicles, among other risk factors. A handful of other highly specialized forms of insurance existed outside of these three sectors."
344,Combination Plan Reinsurance,"Combination plan reinsurance is a form of reinsurance in which the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company of losses in excess of a specific amount, and will also indemnify the ceding company for a fixed percentage of remaining losses after deducting any excess recoveries. Combination plan reinsurance combines features of pro rata insurance (quota share) and excess of loss coverage.","Businesses that use reinsurance companies to reduce risk exposure in exchange for a portion of premiums have several different options when it comes to how they share losses with the reinsurance company. Combination plan reinsurance combines pro rata insurance(sometimes called quota share) and excess of loss insurance, and is most frequently used when a company is switching from pro rata to excess of loss."
345,Combined Physical Damage Coverage,"Combined physical damage coverage is auto insurance that providescoverage for damages caused by collisions and non-collision events. Combined physical damage coverage protects against physical damages to a vehicle, but does not cover personal injuries.","Insurance policies defend the insured against losses from specific risks over a fixed period. If a loss falls within the risks the policy covers, the insured may request payment for damages up to the policy limit."
346,Combined Ratio,"Combined ratio, also called ""the combined ratio after policyholder dividends ratio,""isa measure of profitabilityused by an insurance companyto gaugehow well it is performing in its daily operations.The combined ratio is calculated by taking the sum of incurred losses and expenses and then dividing them by earned premium.",Calculated as:
347,Combined Single Limits,"Combined single limits are a provision of an insurance policy that limits the coverage for all components of a claim to singledollar amount. A combined single limit policy would state that the insurer will pay up to x dollars for a single claim; it doesnt matter whether all components of the claim is related to one persons injuries, or whether there are three injured parties represented by the claim. The combined single limit maxes out at the stated dollar amount either way.","The opposite of a combined single limit is a split limit, which states different maximum dollar amounts that the insurer will pay for different components of a claim. Whereas a policy with a combined single limit might state that it will pay a maximum of $300,000 per incident, a policy with split limits might pay $100,000 per person per incident for bodily injury, with a maximum of $300,000 per incident. If one person seeks $250,000 in damages for their injuries, the single limit policy will cover all $250,000, but the most dollar amount that the split limit policy will pay is $100,000. The only way the split limit policy will pay $300,000 is if three different people each have $100,000 in claims."
348,Commercial General Liability (CGL),"Commercial general liability (CGL)is a type of insurance policy that provides coverage to a business for bodily injury, personal injuryand property damage caused by the business operations, products, or injury that occurs on the business premises. Commercial general liabilityis considered comprehensive business insurance, though it does not cover all risks a business may face.","Commercial general liability policies have different levels of coverage. A policy may include premises coverage, which protects the business from claims that occur at the business physical location during regular business operations. It may also include coverage for bodily injury and property damage that is the result of finished products. Excess liability coverage canbe purchased in order to cover claims that exceed the limit of the CGL policy. Some commercial general liability policies may have exclusions to what actions are covered. For example, a policy may not cover the costs associated with a product recall."
349,Commercial Health Insurance,Commercial health insurance is a type of health insurance that covers medical expenses and disability income for the insured.,"Commercial health insurance policies are sold by for-profit carriers. They are usually sold by agents and brokers, but can also be purchased directly from the carrier in many instances. These policies vary widely in the amount and types of specific coverage that they provide."
350,Commercial Lines Insurance,"Commercial lines insurance includes property and casualty insurance products for businesses. Commercial lines Insurance helps keep the economy running smoothly by protecting businesses from potential losses they couldnt afford to cover on their own, which allows businesses to operate when it might otherwise be too risky to do so.","Commercial lines insurance include products, such as commercial auto insurance, workers compensation insurance, federal flood insurance, aircraft insurance, ocean marine insurance and medical malpractice insurance. Commercial lines protect businesses against potentially devastating financial losses caused by accidents, lawsuits, natural disasters and other adverse events. Available coverages and premium costs vary by business type, sizeand location. In 2013, the five largest issuers of commercial lines, as measured by the amount of premiums written, were American International Group (AIG), Travelers, Liberty Mutual, Zurich Insurance Group and ACE Ltd. None of these companies had an especially large market share, however."
351,Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey (CLIPS),A Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey (CLIPS)is an annual survey from the consulting firm Willis Towers Watsonthat reveals commercial insurance pricing trends. It tracks prices charged by over 30 insurance carriers for underwriting business casualty and property insurance policies.,"The Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Surveycan be used to track year-over-year variations in policy prices. CLIPS is considered an industry-leading survey and benchmarking tool.Commercial property insurance covers potential financial loss due to damage, theft or loss of real or personal property. Casualty insurance provides financial coverage for the actual business itself. For example, if a business was unable to open because of damage caused by fire, the property insurance would apply to the physical building while the casualty insurance would help compensate for the financial loss created by the interruption in work. Casualty insurance options have grown since the 1990s to include coverage for business interruption due to terrorism, government instability, cyber fraud and identity theft. The variation in policy premiums compose the premise of CLIPS."
352,Commercial Multiple Peril Policy,"A commercial multiple peril policyoffers at least two forms of coverage, including a variety of losses incurred from numerous causes. Commercial multiple peril policies can cover a variety of losses incurred from numerous causes. Some of the types of coverage offered include business crime, business automobile, boiler and machinery, marine and farm.","Commercial multiple peril insurance is the most popular type of commercial package insurance policiesin the U.S. property and casualty insurance market. These policies are sold by property and casualty insurers to businesses of various types. Theytypically combineseveral property and general liability coverages under a single policy, creating a convenience in coverage for the insured. It isoften available for a discount. It is rated by applying factors known as package modifications at the end of the rating process. This permits each coverage in the package to be analyzed in combination with results from the monoline coverage."
353,Commercial Output Policy (COP),"Commercial Output Policy (COP)- is an insurance policy that provides both commercial property and inland marine coverage. A commercial output policy, or COP, is an updated version of the manufacturers output policy, or MOP, which was first provided in the 1950s. The wordoutput in commercial output policy refers to items that are processed or created through the business manufacturing process.","Companies depend on keeping their goods damage-free throughout the entire production process, but must also consider the potential for damage as the goods are shipped outside of the factory walls. Businesses that operate in multiple locations may consider a commercial output policy in order to protect against risk exposures associated with transporting output between different facilities, as well as transporting to customers. Types of businesses that may purchase a commercial output policy include manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and other companies that process and assemble goods."
354,Commercial Package Policy (CPP),"A commercial package policy is an insurance policy that combines coverage for multiple perils, such as liability and property risk. A commercial package policy, or CPP, allows a business to take a flexible approach to obtaining insurance coverage, and may allow the business to pay out a lower amount of premiums than ifit purchased a separate policy for each risk.","Insurance companies typically write commercial package policies for small or mid-sized businesses. These types of businesses may have smaller liability needs because they do not operate large facilities, or because they only require additional insurance protection for small risks. For example, a light manufacturing company or car wash facility is less likely to require the same amount of coverage that a real estate developer requires."
355,Commercial Property Floater,"A commercial property floater is a rider thatis attached to a commercial insurance policy to protect property that a company doesn't store at a fixed location.For example, a construction company may want to guard equipment it owns that it uses at various sites.Companies may pay an additionalpremiumto add such a rider to a commercial insurance policy. ",Commercial property floaters protect assets even though the insurance company underwriting the policy understands that various assets such as equipment may not be at a specific location. The floater assures that the insurance provider would cover any claimsresulting from loss ofthose assets.
356,Commercial Property Insurance,"Commercial property insurance is used to cover any commercial property. Commercial property insurance protects commercial property from such perils as fire, theft and natural disaster. Avariety of businesses, including manufacturers, retailers, service-oriented businesses and not-for-profit organizations carry commercial propertyinsurance. ","Commercial property insurance can be a major expense for businesses that use equipment worth millions or billions of dollars, such as railroads and manufacturers. This insurance essentially provides the same kind of protection as property insurance for consumers. However, businesses can usually deduct the cost of commercial property insurance premiums as expenses."
357,Commissioners Standard Industrial Mortality Table,Commissioners standard industrial mortality table is a mathematical table used by actuaries to calculate the nonforfeiture values of industrial life insurance policies. Commissioners Standard Industrial mortality tables are used to establish the minimum amount that must be paid to the policyholder. These tables create uniform payout standards for industrial life insurance policies.,"The life expectancy of the insured in these tables is shorter than that of standard tables like the commissioners' standard ordinary mortality table. Therefore, the premiums for industrial policies are somewhat higher than for standard policies. This is due to the fact that the average life expectancy for the insured in industrial policies tends to be less than those who are insured by standard life policies. Industrial insurance covers employees for work-related injuries and illnesses, including medical, hospital, and other rehabilitation services essential to an injured worker's treatment and recovery."
358,Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table ,The commissioners standard ordinary mortality table is an actuarial table used to compute the minimum non-forfeiture values of ordinary life insurance policies. The commissioners standard ordinary (CSO) mortality table reflects the probability that people in various age groups will die in a given year.,Commissioners standard ordinary mortalitytables stand in contrast to industrial mortality tables for industrial life insurance policies. CSO tables require lower premiums from policy owners than industrial policies because these individuals tend to live longer. Both types of tables must be approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
359,Commissioners' Values,Commissioners' values are specific values that are assigned to securities as per the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The commissioners' values act as a guideline for insurance carriers when they list securities as assets in their annual reports. These values are uniform for all insurance carriers.,The commissioners' values provide insurance commissioners with a way to value securities. This in turn allows them to make certain that carriers have adequate assets to meet their reserve requirements. These values thereby ensure that carriers are financially competent to transact business within the state.
360,Common Policy Declarations,"Common policydeclarationsare located in a separate section of a property or casualty insurance policy andcontain all of the basic information that defines the policy. These declarations include the name of the insured, the amount of coverage and the name, description and location of the item or items being covered.","Common policy declarations are a basic part of every insurance contract. They also include the dates from which coverage begins and ends, as well as the amount of premium required. The premium that insurance companies charge is based on the information found in the declaration."
361,Commutation,"Commutation refers to theright that a beneficiary has to exchange one type of income for another. Commutation is offered to beneficiaries of annuities and life insurance policies, so that they might receive a lump-sum payment instead of a series of future payments. When this happens, the net present value of all remaining payments is computed into a single payment that is given to the beneficiary.","Commutation can provide a larger sum of money to a beneficiary who needs it now. This can be a tremendous helpfor those who need cash to pay for medical or other bills that cannot wait. However, this right must be accorded to the beneficiary in the policy.The insured will alsobenefitfrom a higher level of certainty in their financial life by settling for a certain immediate amount rather than an uncertain future amount. The insured will also stand to save on administrative costs associated with monitoring and collection activities on the part of the insurer."
362,Commutation Agreement,"A commutation agreement is areinsurance agreement in which the reinsurer and ceding company agree on the conditions under which all obligations for both parties in the agreement are discharged. A commutation agreement includes the methods for valuing any claims or outstanding charges, and how any remaining losses or premiums are to be paid.","Insurance companies use reinsurance in order to reduce their overall risk exposure in exchange for a portion of the premium. Reinsurers are responsible for the risks that are ceded, with coverage limits determined in the reinsurance treaty. Reinsurance contracts can vary in length, but may last for extended periods of time."
363,Company-Owned Life Insurance - COLI,Company-owned life insurance (COLI) is a life-insurance policy that pays a benefit to the company when an insured employee dies.,"Company-owned life insurance (COLI), or corporate-owned life insurance, is typically taken out on a group of critical employees and pays a benefit when any one of those employees dies. Unlike typical life-insurance policies, COLI policies pay the death benefit to the same entity that pays the premiums."
364,Comparative Interest Rate Method,"The comparative interest rate method is a way to calculate the difference in cost between two different types of insurance policies. Specifically, the comparative interest rate method is used to illustrate the difference between the cost of a whole life policy and a decreasing term policy with a side fund.","The comparative interest rate method offers potential insurers and their agents the ability to make comparisons in costs and benefits across the two different types of products. Since interest amounts change, the value of the products can change over time, as can an individuals needs."
365,Comparative Negligence,"Comparative negligence is a principle of tort law that applies to casualty insurance in certain states. Comparative negligence states that when an accident occurs, the fault and or negligence of each party involved is based upon their respective contributions to the accident. This allows insurers to assign blame and pay claims accordingly.","Comparative negligence is most commonly used to assign blame in auto accidents. If two drivers both break the same traffic laws in an accident, then both may be denied their claims. Many carriers assign blame between drivers on a percentage basis, such as 70/30."
366,Compensatory Damages,"Compensatory damages is money awarded to a plaintiff to compensate for damages, injury, or another incurred loss. Compensatory damages are awarded in civil court cases where loss has occurred as a result of the negligence or unlawful conduct of another party. To receive compensatory damages, the plaintiff has to prove that a loss occurred, and that it was attributable to the defendant. The plaintiff must also be able to quantify the amount of loss in the eyes of the jury or judge.","Compensatory damages differ from punitive damages, which may compensate over and above any loss or damage incurred and are meant to provide an incentive against repeating the act that caused the plaintiff's loss or damages.Cases related to compensatory and punitive damages are a major source of debate in the field of health insurance, as proponents of tort reform claim that excessive damages above the actual loss incurred increase the overall cost of healthcare. Compensatory damages are intended to compensate the plaintiff of a lawsuit with enough money to cover the loss caused by thedefendant. Compensatory damages can be classified as two types:actual and general."
367,Complete Retention,Complete retention is a risk management technique in which a company facing a risk or risks decides to absorb any potential loss rather than transfer that risk to an insurer or other party.,"Complete retention means that no outside financing option is sought out. The business would be responsible for all costs and damages that occur as the result of a crisis, accident or other unforeseen incident that results in loss."
368,Completed Operations Insurance,Completed operations insurance covers a contractor's liability for property damage or injuries to a third party once contracted operations cease. Construction products and the manufacturing of consumer goods and medicines will usually carry completed operations insurance. General liability insurance most often includes completed operations insurance. Contractors and manufacturers may also purchase additional or separate policies in amounts that are more than thegeneral liability limits forloss and injury incurred off the insured's property.,"Buying completed operations insurance transfers the risks associated with a contractor's or manufacturer's finished product to a third party. Even though a contractor completes work, loss preventionand commercial insurancecoverage are essential to relieve him of liability expenses."
369,Composite Rate,A composite rate is an insurance premium based on the average risk profile of a group rather than the risk profile of an individual policyholder. A composite rate implies that all members of a particular group pay the same insurance premium for insurance against a specific peril.,"When an insurance company underwrites a new policy, it agrees to indemnify the policyholder against a particular peril in exchange for a premium payment. Determining the amount of premium to charge the policyholder is a critical step in the underwriting process. Underestimating the severity or the frequency of possible claims can lead the insurer to undercharge the policyholder for coverage. Undercharging may cause the insurer to usecapital reserves, which will make the policy unprofitable."
370,Compound Probability,Compound probability is a mathematical term relating to the likeliness of two independent events occurring. Compound probability is equal to the probability of the first event multiplied by the probability of the second event. Compound probabilities are used by insurance underwriters to assess risks and assign premiums to various insurance products.,"The most basic example of compound probability is flipping a coin twice. If the probability of getting heads is 50 percent, then the chances of getting heads twice in a row would be (.50 X .50), or .25 (25 percent).A compound probabilitycombines at least two simple events, also known as a compound event. The probability that a coin will show heads when you tossonly onecoin is a simple event."
371,Comprehensive Glass Policy,"An insurance policy that covers glass that has been broken or damaged. A comprehensive glass policy covers a wider range of manufactured glass products than a standard glass policy, which typically only covers plate glass.","Homeowners and businesses often underestimate the cost of replacing broken or damaged glass windows and doors. Unlike some types of cosmetic building repairs that can be deferred until a later time, a window separating the outside elements from the inside of the building has to be replaced immediately if damaged. Many windows are specially cut and made to fit a specific space, which can add to the expense because a replacement is unlikely to be found at a local store. Glass specialists are often needed."
372,Comprehensive Insurance,"Comprehensive insurance is a type of automobile insurance that covers damage to your car from causes other than a collision. Comprehensive insurance would cover your vehicle if it was destroyed by a tornado, dented by a run-in with a deer, spray painted by a vandal, damaged by a break-in or crushed by a collapsing garage, among other causes.","Comprehensive insurance, collision insurance and liability insurance are the three components of an automobile insurance policy. State law requires drivers to carry liability insurance, but collision and comprehensive insurance are optional if someone ownsavehicle outright. If a personhasfinanced the vehicle, theauto loan company might require comprehensive insurance. If the car ownerhaspaid for the vehicle in full, and theycant afford comprehensive insurance, theyown an older automobile that doesnt have much value, theythink theyre at low-risk of non-collision damageor theyprefer to self-insure, the ownercan choose not to purchase comprehensive insurance. On the other hand, even ifsomeoneowns anautomobile free and clear, if theylive in a rural area where collisions with animals are common, in a stormy area that often gets hailor in a higher-crime part of town where break-ins and theft occur regularly, theymight want to purchase comprehensive insurance."
373,Comprehensive Personal Liability,Comprehensive personal liability (CPL) insurance is a component of a homeowners or umbrella insurance policy that protects the policyholder and members of the policyholders household against having to pay large sums out-of-pocket if they are held responsible for a personal liability claim.,Comprehensive personal liabilityinsurance is coverage that protects an individual against claims for liability arising out of bodily injury or property damage claims related to personal activities. There are three ways to get this coverage:
374,Compulsory Insurance,"Compulsory insurance is any type of insurance an individual or business is legally required to buy. Compulsory insurance is mandatory for individuals and businesses that want to engage in certain financially risky activities, such as operating an automobile or operating a business with employees. Compulsory insurance is supposed to protect accident victims against the costs of recovering from an accident that someone else, such as another driver or an employer, has caused. Insurance is regulated at the state level, so each state decides what types of insurance will be compulsory and how much coverage policyholders must purchase. Policyholders may purchase higher limits of coverage if they think the compulsory minimums are insufficient.","Perhaps the most well-known type of compulsory insurance isautomobile liability insurance, which drivers are required to carry. For example, since 2001, Mississippi drivers have been required to carry auto liability insurance and keep their proof of insurance cards in their vehicles. The only state where automobile liability insurance is not compulsory is New Hampshire. Similarly, motorcycle drivers face compulsory insurance in every state except Montana, New Hampshire and Washington."
375,Concealment,"Concealment is the omission of information which would affect the issuance or the rate of an insurance contract.If the insurer has no access to the nondisclosedinformation and that information is material to the decision-making process, the insurer can nullify the insurancecontract. Should the provider learn of withheld information after the policyholder files a claim, the provider may refuse to pay out on the claims related to the concealed information. ",Concealment applies any time an insured party fails to provide information to an insurer which could affect the terms of the policy. Note that this includes situations in which an insurance company does not ask a direct question about the information in question.Insurance policies generally lump concealment in with misrepresentation as a reason to void or alter a contract.
376,Concession,"A concession is a selling group's take as per a stock or bond underwriting agreement. The calculation ofcompensation is the differencebetween what the public pays for the securities and what the issuing company receives from the sale based on a per-share of per-bond basis. Included in the underwriting spread is the management fee, selling concession, and underwriter's compensation.","When a publicly traded company wishes to raise capital by issuing stocks or bonds, it hires an investment bank to act as anunderwriterand handle the transaction. The underwriter receives compensation for the securities it sells. An underwriter is not always responsible for the securities it does not sell, as outlined in the underwriting agreement."
377,Concurrent Causation,"Concurrent causation is a method of handling losses or damages which occur from more than one cause. The roots of concurrent causation are from legal rulings and opinions, which form a body of precedent and becomes useful when parties in a dispute require the decision of a court. In insurance, concurrent causation happens when a property experiences a loss from two separatecauses when one has policy coverage, and the other does not. Depending on the specific situations, the type of policy in effect, and the state court in which disagreements will be heard, the damages from both causes are likely to be covered.",Concurrent causation may also be a factor in liability insurance policies.
378,Concurrent Insurance,"Concurrent insurance is when two or more insurance policies that provide coverage for the same risks over the same period of time. Concurrent insurance is most often used when an insured person or business purchases policies in addition to a primary policy, with the additional policies providing excess coverage.",Concurrent insurance policies might be a good idea for an individual or business that believes that a particular peril poses a significant risk that cannot be effectively covered by a single policy. Purchasing one or more concurrentpolicies may be a prudent course of action if the cost is not prohibitive.
379,Concurrent Periods,Concurrent periods is a term used by insurance companies to refer to a period of time in which a temporary disability insurance policyholder has more than one injury preventing them from working.,"Concurrent periods for unrelated injuries allow the insurer to consider the injuries as one single injury, and thus allow the insurer to pay the policyholder a single disability payment rather than multiple disability payments."
380,Conditional Binding Receipt,"A conditional bindingreceipt is involved in life, health and certain property insurance contracts; if the insured is deemed to be covered by the insurer, the coverage begins on the date the insured receives the conditional binding receipt. Typically, a premium payment must be received by the insurer along with a completed acceptable application in order for the insured to obtain the receipt.This may also be called a ""conditional receipt"" or a ""binding receipt,"" depending on the type of insurance.","If a premium accompanies an application, a conditional binding receipt provides thatcoverage will be in force from the date of application or medical examination,as longthe insurer would have issued the coverage on the basis of the facts revealed on the application, medical examination and other usual sources of underwriting information. A life and health insurance policy without a conditional binding receipt is not effective until it is delivered to the insured and the premium is paid."
381,Conditional Reserves,Conditional reserves are held by insurance companies to meet obligations in short order and are an important measure of a companys ability to cover expenses.,"Conditional reserves can be thought of as a rainy-day fund for insurance companies to help cover unanticipated expenses during times of financial stress. Insurers must be prepared to meet their obligations at all times and if an insurance company is unprepared by not having enough money set aside with acceptable liquidity, it may result in them becoming insolvent. To guard against this possibility, state insurance commissioners and insurance guarantee associations require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of reserves, which cannot be used like a regular asset, and furthermore to list conditional reserves separately in their financial reports."
382,Conditional Sales Floater,"A conditional sales floater is a type of insurance that protects a seller of property that is purchased in installments or on a conditional basis. If the property is damaged prior to being fully paid off, the seller is reimbursed.","A conditional sales floater is alsoknown as an ""installment sales floater.""Conditional sales policies can be used to protect everything from TVs to cars, boats and homes. The policy will generally only indemnify the seller for the portion of the property that has yet to be paid off, or the original sales price minus the aggregate payments made by the purchaser."
383,Conditionally Renewable Policy,A conditionally renewableinsurance policy provision allows the insurer to not allow a policy to be renewed under certain conditions. A conditionally renewable policy can be renewed unless the conditions outlined in the policy occur.,"The conditionally renewable provision thatallows an insurance company to cancel or not renew a policy benefits the insurer, not the policyholder. Insurers may offer several different renewal options for the policies that they underwrite."
384,Conduit Issuer,"A conduit issuer is an organization, usually a government agency, that issues municipal securities to raise capital for revenue-generating projects where the funds generated are used by a third party (known as the ""conduit borrower"") to make payments to investors. The conduit financing is typically backed by either the conduit borrower's credit or funds pledged toward the project by outside investors. If a project fails, and the security goes into default, it falls to the conduit borrower's financial obligation, not the conduit issuer.","Common types of conduit financing include industrial development revenue bonds (IDRBs), private activity bonds and housing revenue bonds (both for single-family and multifamily projects). Most conduit-issued securities are for projects to benefit the public at large (i.e. airports, docks, sewage facilities) or specific population segments (i.e. students, low-income home buyers, veterans)."
385,Confining Condition,A confining condition is anadverse health condition that confines an individual to his or her home or a medical facility such as a hospital or nursing home. Health insurance policy rates take note of individual records and family records of historic confining conditions.,Confining conditions are often used in health insurance plans as a breakpoint for coverage. Some plans will not reimburse for treatments and/or procedures until a specific medical condition has become a confining condition.
386,Connie Lee - College Construction Loan Insurance Association - CCLIA,"Connie Lee, or College Construction Loan Insurance Association (CCLIA), was a formerly government-sponsored enterprise created by the Higher Education Amendments of 1986 and exists now in a different form after being privatized in 1997.","Connie Lee, or College Construction Loan Insurance Association (CCLIA)s purpose was to provide insurance to universities, colleges and other educational institutions for their debt instruments in order to help fund-building initiatives."
387,Consequential Loss,A consequential loss is an indirect loss resulting from an insured's inability to use business property or equipment. A business owner may purchase insurance to protect them against the secondary loss of property and equipment due to a natural disaster or accident. The consequential loss policy will compensate the owner for lost business income.,
388,Consignment Insurance,"Consignment Insurance is a type of insurance that covers loss or damageto items that are on consignment, loan, up for auctionor in the process of transfer. The insurance will pay out only if the damage or loss is incurred while the property is not currently held, maintainedor cared for by the owner. This is a separate form of insurance from that which covers items held in-house as inventory.","Consignment insurance is part of a broader class of gap insurancepolicies meant to provide coveragefor times and situations where more mainstream policies would not typically pay out. Consignment insurance can cover art that is loaned out to a gallery, automobiles sold at a consignment dealership, items under review for auction or transfer of ownership."
389,Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI),"Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) isa typeof portfolio insurance in which the investor sets a floor on the dollar value of their portfolio,then structures asset allocation around that decision. The two asset classes used in CPPI are a risky asset (usually equities or mutual funds)and a conservativeasset of either cash, equivalents or treasury bonds. The percentage allocated to each depends on the ""cushion"" value, defined as (current portfolio value minusfloor value), and a multiplier coefficient, where a higher number denotes a more aggressive strategy.","Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI)allows an investor to maintainexposure to the upside potential of a risky asset while providing acapital guaranteeagainst downside risk. The outcome of the CPPI strategy is somewhat similar to that of buying acall option, but does not use option contracts. Thus,CPPI is sometimes referred to as aconvex strategy, as opposed to a ""concave strategy"" likeconstant mix.Financial institutions sellCPPI products on a variety of risky assets,including equities and credit default swaps."
390,Construction Occupancy Protection Exposure (COPE),"COPE is aset of risks that property insurance underwriters review when determining whether to offer an insurance policy. COPE, which stands for Construction, Occupancy, Protection and Exposure, allows the insurer to evaluate the risks of insuring a piece of real estate, which will ultimately determine whether a policy is created.","The insurance underwriting process involves the identification, classificationand analysis of risks. COPE is used to identify the factors that could cause an insurance company to experience a loss. Insurers build these data elements into their valuation models when predicting the likelihood of a loss, including losses stemming from catastrophes."
391,Constructive Discharge Claim,"Aconstructive discharge claim is aninsurance claim made by an employee who has quit his or her position, and which indicates that the employee made this decision because conditions at the office had become intolerable. Constructive discharge claims are said to begin accruing on the date of the last adverse action of the employer.","In order for a constructive discharge claim to be considered, the claim must demonstrate that the employers action allowed it to indirectly punish (such as through hour reductions) the employee when it could not directly punish (such as by verbally accosting the employee) the employee, until he or she quit."
392,Constructive Total Loss,"A constructive total loss is when the cost forrepair ofan item (e.g., house, boat or car) is more than the current value of that item. It alsorefers to theinsurance claim that is settled for the full valueof the associated coverage.","A constructive total loss for a vehicle means that the damage is so extensive that repairs would equal or surpass the cost of the vehicle or its insurance limit. This type of loss is common in a head-on collision or total wreck.About one in sevencar accidentclaims results in a constructive total loss. A constructive total loss iscommon when a home is destroyed by a serious fire or other severe calamity. In cases where the property is damaged to this point, the insured could potentially allow the insurer to assume all rights over the material good. Suchproperties are usuallydemolished,torn down,scrappedorrecycledfor parts after their policies are settled."
393,Contents Rate,"The contents rate is the premium required to insure the contents of a property rather than the property itself. Contents rate is used in determining coverage for fire damage in property insurance, and is generally higher than the rate charged for the building itself.","The contents rate is calculated after the buildings rate is calculated.Separating the rates charged for a buildings contents and for the building reflect the risks that insurance companies face for claims. A fire is much more likely to damage what is inside the building than the building itself, whether the damage is caused by the fire itself, by smoke caused by the fire, or water caused by fire suppression efforts."
394,Contingent Commission,"A contingent commission is a commission paid to an intermediary by an insurance or reinsurance company with a value dependent on the occurrence of anevent.The amount of acontingent commission may, for example, dependon how profitable the policyholder is to the insurer or reinsurer. Contingent commissions are higher when the insurer or reinsurer doesn't suffer losses from claims, and theyare lower when policyholders are riskier.","Contingent commissions differ from more traditional commission structures because the commission is not collected in the event that the policy is sold. The event that the compensation is contingent on may vary, according to the needs of the insurer or reinsurer, and it may include the profitability of the policy or the amount of business that the client brings in. This type of commission may be paid in addition to a sales commission based on the amount of premium."
395,Continuing Claims,"Continuing claims refers to unemployed workers that qualify for benefits under unemployment insurance. In order to be included in continuing claims, the person must have been covered by unemployment insurance and be currently receiving benefits. Data on unemployment claims is published by the Department of Labor on a weekly basis, allowing for frequent updates on the levels of unemployment.","Continuing claimsdata refers to unemployed peoplewho have already filed aclaim and who are continuing to receive weekly benefits. Critics point to the volatility of the data which makes it somewhat imprecise as a snapshot of employment conditions. When combined with other indicators onto a four-week moving average, it provides a clearer indication."
396,Continuing Undertaking Rule,"Continuing undertaking rule is a legal rule that temporarily stops the statute of limitations from moving to expiry for claims of negligence. The continuing undertaking rule is a feature of tort law, and the temporary stoppage is referred to as atoll.",Continuing undertaking rule is also called the continuous treatment rule.Courts may place a limit on the amount of time that can pass between when an individual or business experiences a loss or damage and when that individual or business files a claim. This limits the filing of a lawsuit if too much time has passed.
397,Continuous Contract,"A continuous contract is areinsurance contract that does not have a fixed contract end date, and which will continue to be renewed and be in effect until one of the parties in the contract terminates it. Continuous contracts are different from standard reinsurance contracts in that they do not provide coverage for only a fixed period of time.","When entering into areinsurance contract, the parties involved may decide that they want a continuous contract in orderto renew the policy indefinitely. The contract language will define the riskscoveredand will also indicate the procedures that either party can follow in order to provide a notice of termination. The notice could be a written notice provided one month before the contract is set to renew, or may follow whatever notice period to whichboth parties agree. The validity portion of the insurance contract may say, for example, that the contract is considered continuous unless both parties indicate that it is not to be considered as such."
398,Continuous Injury Trigger,"A continuous injury trigger is a principle under which all commercial general liability insurance policies are triggered if a policy is in effect when an individual is either exposed to a harmful condition, suffers an actual injury or condition or an injury or condition is manifest.",A continuous injury trigger is one of several theories that govern disagreements over whether or not a specific injury or condition is covered by a particular insurance policy. Disagreements tend to arise when the exact moment of injury is not clear. Examples include prolonged exposure to harmful materials or progressive property damage due to defective construction.
399,Contract Holder,"A contract holder is an individual or organization owed a return on a contractual obligation. If all parties meet the terms of the contract, the contract holder receives the full benefits outlined in the contract. In broad terms, a contract holder owns a promise of a financial return on a specified date, usually in return for something of value.","In the insurance industry, the contract holder is usually the policyholder. "
400,Contractor Fraud,"Contractor fraud is when illegal business practices are committed by firms hired to reform, renovate, repair or build residential properties. Contractorfraud is typically carried out by small firms promising quick repairs or upgrades for below market prices. The work is usually substandard, unnecessary or may even cause damage to previously undamaged parts of a home. The victim of contractor fraud is often pressured into paying for the work through threats and intimidation.","Contractor fraudoften ends up costing the victim twice because they get taken in by the fraud and then have to pay a legitimate firm to bring the work up to standard or repair the damage. Organizations like the Better Business Bureauhave made it harder for these fraudsters to prey on informed consumers, but some fraudulent contractors continue to target vulnerable groups such as theelderly by going door to door."
401,Contractors Professional Liability Insurance,"Contractors professional liability insurance is liabilityinsurancethat provides coverage to contractors and building professionals for construction errors. Contractors professional liability insurance, or CPL insurance, is purchased by contractors that provide design and building services, and provides coverage of errors made by the contractor as well as errors made by third-parties hired by the contractor, such as engineers, architects and other vendors.","Contractors professional liability insurance, or CPL insurance, provides protection to contractors and building professionals in case construction errors occur during construction of a building project. Designing and building a structure can be a complex process involving many parties, including architects, designers, engineers, building contractors, and other building specialists."
402,Contractors' All Risks (CAR) Insurance,"Contractors' all risks (CAR) insurance is a non-standardinsurance policy that provides coverage forproperty damageand third-party injury or damage claims, thetwo primary types of risks on constructionprojects. Damage toproperty caninclude improper construction ofstructures,damage that happens during a renovationand damage totemporary work erected on-site.Thirdparties, including subcontractors, may also become injured while working at the construction site.CAR insurance not onlycovers those associated risks, but alsobridges these two types of risks into a common policydesigned tocover the gap between exclusions that would otherwise exist ifusing separate policies. CAR insurance coverage is common for suchconstruction projects as buildings, water tanks, sewage treatment plans, flyovers andairports.","Typically, both contractor and employer jointly take outCAR insurance policies, with other parties such as financing companies having the option of being named to the policy. Because multiple parties are included in the policy, they each retain the right to file a claim against the insurer, although all parties have the duty of informing the insurer of any injuries and damages that may result in a claim."
403,Contractual Liability Insurance,Contractual liability insurance protects against liabilities that the policyholder has assumed from entering into a contract of any nature.,"Contractual liability involves the financial consequences emanating from liability, not the assumption of the indemnitee's liability itself. Once the indemnitee accidentally causes or allegedly causes injury or damage to a third party, the indemniteeis stillanswerable for that liability. Thus, liability to a third party for injury or damage cannot be assumed by anyone other than the one who caused the injury or damage. What is being transferred by the indemnitor to the indemnitee, instead, are the financial consequences (i.e., money damages) of the determined indemnitee's liability."
404,Contributory Negligence,"Contributory negligence is the plaintiff's failure to exercise reasonable care for their safety. This universal law rule can bar recovery or reduce the amount of compensation a plaintiff receives if their actions increased the likelihood that an incident occurred. Often, defendants use contributory negligence as a defense.","Determining fault in an accident is a critical aspect of insurance. Insurance companies litigate to ensure that they are only liable for damages caused by their insured client. As well, defense lawyers will attempt to limit responsibility to the smallest extent possible. Reviewing actions that led to an accident, insurers and the courts determine how to assign fault. The determination of fault will ultimately leadto deciding how much the insurer must pay. So as not to affect profitability, insurers seek to pay as little as possible for a claim."
405,Control of Well Insurance,"Control of well insurance, also called well control insurance, covers some or all of the costs associated with regaining control of a well, cleaning up pollution caused by a blowout, and redrilling the well or restoring it to operation.","Control of well insurance helps protect oil and gas companies, which operate in complex environments, often searching for resources far under the ocean or deep underground, and often in difficult conditions. Extracting oil and gas is a complicated process, and circumstances may lead to a well becoming damaged or inoperable due to an explosion or other event. Because of the nature of extraction, it can be difficult to stop the flow of oil and natural gas immediately.Regaining control of a well can be expensive, especially considering that wells are often drilled far under the ground or ocean or are in a remote area. A large amount of oil or natural gas is likely to leak before the flow can be capped, and this material has to be cleaned up and kept from spreading. For example, the Deep Horizon oil spill in 2010 involved an estimated 5 million barrels of oil being spilled. After control of a well has been regained, companies will likely want to bring the well back into operation. This requires restoring the existing well or redrilling the well to the same depth at which it operated previously."
406,Controlled Insurance Program (CIP),"A controlled insurance program (CIP) refers to a type of insurance policy that consolidates coverage for contractors and subcontractors into a single policy. Under this type of insurance program,one party establishes insurance on behalf of all or most of the parties performing work on a specific site or project, usually construction.","Controlled insurance programs (CIPs) are most often utilized with construction projects, since these types of projects typically bring together a number of different types of professional groups."
407,Convention Statement,"A document filed by an insurance or reinsurance company that serves as its annual financial statement. Convention statements are regulated by individual states, and are most commonly associated with companies providing life insurance.","The structure of the convention statement may vary from state to state, as insurance is ultimately regulated on the state level and different jurisdictions may have different requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides a basic format that member states use."
408,Conventional Subrogation,"Conventional subrogation is the relationship between the insured and insurer as defined in an insurance contract, specifically when the insurance contract grants rights of subrogation to the insurer.","Conventional subrogation, also called contractual subrogation, defines the rights of the insurance company after it has paid claims made against a policy.Insurance policies may contain language that entitle an insurer, once losses are paid on claims, to seek recovery of funds from a third party if that third party caused the loss. The insured does not have the right to both file a claim with the insurer to receive the coverage outlined in the insurance policy and to seek damages from the third party that caused the losses."
409,Conversion Privilege ,Conversion privilege is an insurance policy in which the insurer is required to renew or update the policy regardless of the insured's health. An insurance policy with this type of provision allows the insured to switch to a different type of policy without submitting to a physical examination.,"A conversion privilege also guarantees coverage and set premium payments for a certain number of years regardless of the health status of the insured. The conversion privilege provision allowsan employee that participates in a group plantoconvert theirgroup life insurance policy into an individual life insurance policy with littlehassle, without havingto go through another approval process or a medical exam. The life insurance company will extend coveragebased on the fact that theywerealready approved as part of the group life insurance plan."
410,Converted Losses,"Converted losses are the total amount of claims incurred multiplied by a loss conversion factor. Converted losses allow an insurance company to account for loss adjustment expenses, and are used in the calculation of a Retrospective, or Retro, premium.","Converted losses are used to calculate the retrospective rating insurance premium, which is calculated by adding together the basic premium, loss premium, and converted losses, and then multiplying this sum by a tax multiplier. The amount of the tax multiplier varies from state to state, as different states tax policies at different rates. An increase in the loss conversion factor, which adjusts the incurred losses, reduces the premium by increasing the amount of risk that the company is assuming."
411,Convertible Insurance,"Convertible insurance is a type of life insurance that allows the policyholder to change a term policy into a whole or universal policy without going through the health qualification process again. Convertible insurance lets the insured convert a policy that only covers the policyholders beneficiaries for a predetermined number of years into a policy that covers the policyholders beneficiaries indefinitely, as long as the policyholder continues to pay the premiums.","If the policyholder decides to make the conversion on their convertible insurance, the permanent policy will have the same value as the term policy, but the permanent policy will have higher premiums. Even before conversion, convertible insurance will be more expensive than a term insurance policy for the same amount of coverage because there is a built-in cost for the option of being able to make the conversion without a medical exam."
412,Cooperation Clause,"An insurance contract clause that requires the policyholder to assist the insurance company in the event that a claim is filed against the policy. A cooperation clause allows the insurance company to obtain more information about the nature of the circumstances behind the claim, since the insured party is more likely to have detailed information about what happened.","Insurance companies may underwrite policies for thousands of policyholders across a wide geographic area. The insurers are unlikely to know the day-to-day activities of the insured, and are even less likely to know the events that transpired before another party made a claim against the insured. This is the primary reason why insurance policies contain provisions compelling the insured to provide information about what happened if an accident or other event occurs."
413,Cooperative Insurance,"Cooperative (or co-op) insurance is for owners of co-op apartments –or other cooperative organizations –and itcovers losses to their units. For apartment co-ops, coverages includesburglary, fire damage andliability, among others. Generally, a co-op building provides coverage for common areas such as the hallways, basement, roof, elevator and common walkways. The co-op association's insurance policy protects the building, not the individual apartment owners' apartment, unless the damage occurs as a result of something under the association's jurisdiction.","Purchasing cooperative insurance letspolicyholderspool together with others who have similar risks to purchase more extensive coverage at a more affordable rate. For instance, in addition to apartment buildings, trade unions will oftenoffer some form of co-opinsurance, since there may be certain risks that everyone in the union is exposed to, and it makes economic sense to purchase coverage as a group.The typical model for a cooperative is everyoneinvolved in the cooperativethat pays for the insurance receives a portion of ownership of the policy that is proportional to how much they pay. So, those who pay for five percent of the total policy would receive five percent ownership."
414,Coordination Of Coverage,"Coordination of Coverage, which may also be called coordination of benefits, is a process undertaken by insurers to eliminate gaps in apolicyholders individual or businessinsurance coverage.","Coordination of coverage might be limited to a single insurance companys coverage, but can also be a process involving more than one insurer."
415,Corporate Ownership Of Life Insurance (COLI),"Corporate ownership of life insurance (COLI) or corporate-owned life insurance refers to insurance obtained and owned by a company on its employees, where it pays all of the premiums and receives all of the benefits. These insurance policies aretaken out by companies on their employees,with death benefits payable to these companies, rather than to the insured person's family or heirs.","COLI is generally used to protect a company from the costs arising from the unexpected death of an employee, as well as to fund employee benefits. Unlike ""key man"" insurance, which refers to company-owned insurance on directors and top executives, COLI may be taken out on any employee. For this reason, it is sometimes derisively referred to as ""janitor's insurance"" or ""dead peasant insurance."""
416,Corporate Reimbursement Coverage,"Corporate reimbursement coverage is a form of liability insurance that companies purchase to protect themselves against losses due to legal actions against their directors and officers. It is one of three components of directors and officers liability coverage. These are side A, side B and side C.","Corporate reimbursement coverage, also known as side B, is one portion of directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance. D&O is largely structured to protect the individual executive against losses, but the corporate reimbursement feature covers any losses the firm itself might suffer as a result of legal action against those individuals."
417,Correction Notice,"A correction notice indicates that a process or application contains errors or omissions that require corrections. Correction notices are typically issued by government agencies and may be issued for a variety of reasons. The government may want to clarify how organizations can participate in a government-sponsored program, ask applicants to update their applications because of missing or incomplete information, or address how organizations and individuals can comment on a proposed regulation. A correction notice is also sometimes called a notice of correction.","Correction notices are sometimes required after complex legislation is enacted, when lawmakers and government agencies discover that changes are required during the implementation process, such as after the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Government agencies that sponsor insurance programs, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, provide guidelines to organizations that want to offer plans in federally facilitated health insurance marketplaces. These guidelines include operational and technical instructions to help organizations ensure that they are meeting all the necessary requirements, comply with certification standards and include information about the application process."
418,Corridor Deductible,"A corridor deductible is expensespaid by the insured in excess of an insurance policys coverage limit, but below the threshold at which additional coverage options are available.Corridor deductibles bridge the gap between policies that reach the aggregate limit of coverage and any additional coverage that may be in effect.","Corridor deductibles are most commonly found in health and medical insurance plans, specifically those that have co-insurance features. The corridor deductible is usually a fixed dollar amount per loss and applies in the transitional area between basic coverage and major medical expense coverage. Basic policy benefits are paid first, and when the basic policy benefits are exhausted, the corridor deductible then applies. After the corridor deductible is paid,the major medical plan benefits come into effect."
419,Cost Of Tender,Cost of tender is the total charges associated with the delivery and certification of commodities underlying a futures contract. The cost of tender represents the total costs related to taking physical delivery of a commodity. These costs are assessed only if the futures contract holder wishes to receive the commodity rather than close the position prior to expiration.,"The cost of tender is essentially the cost of doing business. Any costs associated with the actual physical delivery of the commodity comprise the cost of tender. For example, if an investor is long corn (owns a futures contract on corn), the seller must deliver the corn to the contract holder when the contract expires (unless the contract holder closes the position prior to expiration). The holder must compensate the seller for the cost of tender, including transportation, carrying costs and any other expenses that are associated with the delivery."
420,"Cost, Insurance and Freight - CIF","Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) means the seller pays costs, freight and insurance against the buyer's risk of loss or damage in transit to destination.","Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) is one of 13 international commerce termsknown asIncoterms. Incotermsare commonly known trade terms first developed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in 1936to govern the shipping policies and responsibilities ofbuyers and sellers, who engage in international trade.Contracts involving international transportation oftenuseabbreviated versions of theseterms todescribe matters such as the time and place of delivery, payment, when the risk of loss shifts from the seller to the buyer and who pays the costs of freight and insurance.Incotermsare often identical in form to domestic terms (such as the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code), but have different meanings. As a result, parties to a contract must expressly indicate the governing law of their terms."
421,Cost-Sharing Reductions,"Cost sharing reductions are a type of federal subsidy distributed as discounts that help reduce out-of-pocket costs for health-care expenses, including:","The cost-sharing reduction subsidy wasa provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010 by President Barack Obama."
422,Council Of Insurance Agents & Brokers,"Council Of Insurance Agents & Brokers is a global organization representing the leading commercial insurance agencies and brokerage firms. Membership in this organization, which is also known as The Council, comes with industry intelligence and continuing education opportunities. The organization also produces a quarterly Commercial Insurance Market Index that tracks pricing trends, underwriting practices and availability of commercial property and casualty lines.","The organization, founded in 1913 and headquartered in Washington, DC, also serves as an advocacy group to represent the interests of insurance companies before U.S. state and federal governments, as well as international governments. Its political action committee works to support candidates who agree with its views and also lobbies Congress on relevant issues."
423,Counsel Selection Provision,"A counsel selection provision is part of a professional or corporate liability insurance contract – a provision that allows the policyholder to select or approve the legal counsel that will represent him or her in the case of a claim. More specifically, counsel selection provisions allow directors and other corporate personnel who may be called to testify during an insurance claims case to be represented by an attorney who defends their interests as well as the interests of the company that has purchased the liability policy.","Counsel selection provisions are an adjunct to the indemnity clauses of the insurance policies companies purchase in order to protect their senior management, such as officers and directors, from certain risks. Often an important recruiting tool in attracting executive talent, these indemnity clauses allow the company to hire lawyers to defend employees in case of a trial arising from a lawsuit. Directors and officers of a company naturally want to ensure that competent lawyers represent them if they are forced to appear in court; however, if the company is responsible for choosing the counsel, then managers could wind up not receiving the best defense. It's possible that they will be represented by lawyers who are not concerned with their best interests, but rather the best interests of the company. Even though he or she is a corporate employee, the reputation of the indemnified individual is different than that of the company – meaning that the individuals reputation may be damaged while that of the companys may be protected."
424,Counseling Liability,Counseling liability is a term used to refer to legalliabilitiesarising from the provision of counseling services.,
425,Covenant Not To Execute,"A covenant not to execute is alawsuit agreement in which the plaintiff agrees not to execute a judgment against the defendant. A covenant not to execute in an insurance claim lawsuit is typically provided by a plaintiff who wants to seek a portion of the overall damages from the insured, while also reserving the right to make further claims against other policies until all damages are covered.","The covenant not to execute is a promise by the plaintiff not to seek further damages from the insured.Insurance claim lawsuits involve three main parties: the insured, the insurer, and the claimant. Each party has its separate goals it hopes to achieve. The insured wants to settle for as little as possible. The insurer wants to reduce its loss exposure to the smallest amount. The claimant wants the most money it can get from the lawsuit."
426,Covenant Not To Sue,"Covenant not to sue is alegal agreement in which the party seeking damages agrees not to sue the party that it has cause against. A covenant not to sue may indicate that the potential claimant will not sue in perpetuity, or may indicate that the claimant may postpone a lawsuit for a defined period of time.","A covenant not to sue legally obliges a party that could initiate a lawsuit not to do so. The covenant is specifically made between two parties, and any third party that wants to make a claim is legally allowed to do so. Covenants not to sue are used to settle specific legal issues outside of the court system. Parties may enter into this type of agreement in order to prevent a protracted, expensive lawsuit. In exchange for the covenant, the party that could seek damages may be provided with compensation or may be given assurances that the other party in the agreement will conduct a specific action."
427,Cover Note,"A cover note is a temporary document issued by an insurance company that provides proof ofinsurance coverage until a final insurance policy can be issued. A cover note is different froma certificate of insurance or an insurance policy document. A covernote features the name of the insured, the insurer, the coverageand what is being covered by the insurance.","Insurance companies issue a cover note in order to provide an individual with proof of insurance before all the insurance paperwork has been processed. During this time, the insurer may continue to evaluate the risks associated with insuring the holder of the cover note, and the cover note will continue to serve as the insureds proof that he or she has purchased coverage until the insurer issues the policy documents and certificate of insurance. In general, the cover note provides the same level of coverage as the full insurance policy, though insurers may place some restrictions while they make any final determinations on the risks associated with the insurance policy."
428,Coverage Trigger,"A coverage trigger is anevent that must occur in order for a liability policy to apply to a loss. Coverage triggers are outlined in the policy language, and courts will use different legal theories pertaining to triggers to determine whether policy coverage applies.","Insurance companies use coverage triggers to ensure that the policies they underwrite only apply when specific events occur. They do this to ensure that they only pay claims under certain circumstances, though this can shift the burden of proving that a policy should apply to the insured."
429,Credentialing Liability,"Credentialing liability refers to the responsibility that a hospital or medical facility carries for the staff practicing under its purview. Issues of credentialing liability arise when hospitals allow doctors and other medical professionals to practice who should not have been allowed to, whether for disciplinary reasons, a failure to meet educational requirements, or from malpractice.","Credentialing liability falls on hospitals, clinics and other medical facilities are required to ensure that doctors, physician assistants, nurses, and other medical staffers are properly vetted and credentialed before allowing them to treat patients. When patients are injured by a member of a hospitals medical staff, they and their lawyers may seek to determine whether the staff member should have been allowed to practice in the first place."
430,Credibility Theory,"Credibility theory refers to tools, policiesand procedures used by actuaries when examining data in order to estimate risk. Credibility theory uses mathematical models and methods for making experience-based estimates, in whichexperience refers to historical data.","Credibility theory helps actuaries understandthe risks associated with providing coverage, and it allows insurance companies to limit its exposure to claims and losses. Insurance companies and actuaries develop models based on historical losses, with the model taking into account a number of assumptions that have to be statistically tested in order to determine how credible they are. For example, an insurance company will examine losses previously incurred from insuring a particular group of policyholders in order to estimate how much it may cost to insure a similar group in the future."
431,Credit Default Insurance,"Credit default insurance is a financial agreement – usually a credit derivative such as a credit default swap, total return swap, or credit linked note – to mitigate the risk of loss from default by a borrower or bond issuer.",Credit default insurance allows for the transfer of credit risk without the transfer of an underlying asset. The most widely used type of credit default insurance is a credit default swap. Credit default swaps transfer credit risk only; they do not transfer interest rate risk. Total return swaps transfer both credit and interest rate risk.
432,Credit Insurance,"Credit insurance is a type of insurance policy purchased by a borrower that pays off one or more existing debts in the event of a death, disability, or in rare cases, unemployment. Credit insurance is marketed most often as a credit card feature, with the monthly cost charging a low percentage of the card's unpaid balance.","Credit insurance can be a financial lifesaver in the event of certain catastrophes. However, many credit insurance policies are overpriced relative to their benefits, as well as loaded with fine print that can make it hard to collect. If you feel that credit insurance would bring you peace of mind, be sure to read the fine print and compare your quote against a standard term life insurance policy."
433,Credit Life Insurance,"Credit life insurance is atype oflife insurancepolicy designed to pay off a borrower's debt if the borrower dies. Theface valueof a credit life insurance policy decreases proportionately with the outstanding loan amount as the loan is paid off over time, until both reach zero value.","Credit life insurance is typically sold by banks at a mortgage closing; it could also be offered when you take out a car loan or a line of credit. The pitch is to protect your heirs if you die, since the policy will pay off the loan. If your spouse or someone else is a co-signer on your mortgage, credit life insurance would protect them from making loan payments after your death. This could be appealing if you are the primary breadwinner in your family, and the loan co-signer would be unable to make payments in the event of your death."
434,Creditable Coverage,"Creditable coverage is health insurance, prescription drug, or other health benefit plan that meets a minimum set of qualifications. Types of creditable coverage plans include group health plans, individual health plans, student health plans, as well as a variety of government-sponsored or government-provided plans. Creditable coverage is used to determine coverage and costs associated with pre-existing conditions, and whether policyholders have to pay late enrollment penalties.","Creditable coverage is most closely associated with prescription drug coverage. Insurers whose policies include prescription drug coverage are required to notify policyholders who are eligible for Medicare that their policy meets or exceeds the coverage offered by a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. If the policyholders coverage is considered creditable, he or she may be eligible for subsidies."
435,Crop-Hail Insurance,"Crop-hail insurance is a type of insurance that insures against crop damage caused by hail, as well as damage caused to crops from fires. Crop-hail insurance is purchased by farmers, and is designed to protect crops while they are still in the field and have yet to be harvested.","Crop-hail insurance protects the livelihood of farmers, who areoften at the mercy of the weather. Sudden events, such as a winter storm or a fire, can wipe out a harvest. In the United States, farmers can purchase crop insurance from Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), a government program. This type of policy is called Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI), and generally covers losses due to changes in the price of farm commodities."
436,Cross-Liability Coverage,"Cross-liability coverage is an endorsement that provides coverage for insurance policies that cover multiple parties, and in which one of the parties is held liable for a claim made by another party underthe same contract. Cross-liability coverage treats the different parties in the contract as if they had their own separate policies.","Cross-liability refers to the ability of one insured party to sue another insured party if both parties are under the same contract. Standard liability insurance typicallyincludes a cross-liability clauseknown as aSeparation of Insureds agreement.Thelanguage should read something like this:Every insured claimed against under this policy will be treated, at the time of the claim, as if they were the only insured under the policy. This clause essentially allows one party that the policy coversto sue a second party covered in the same policy."
437,Cross-Sell,"To cross-sell is to sell related or complementary products to an existing customer. Cross-selling is one of the most effective methods of marketing. In the financial services industry, examples of cross-selling include selling different types of investments or products to investors or tax preparation services to retirement planning clients.","If done efficiently, cross-selling can translate into significant profits for stockbrokers, insurance agents, and financial planners. Licensed income tax preparers can offer insurance and investment products to their tax clients, and this is among the easiest of all sales to make. Effective cross-selling is a good business practice and is a useful financial planning strategy, as well.Often, up-selling is confused with cross-selling.Up-selling is the act of selling a more comprehensive or higher-end version of the current product. Cross-selling is the act of selling a different product than what exists to provide an additional benefit to the customer."
438,Cumis Counsel,"Cumis Counsel is legal counsel chosen by the insured when the insurer has a conflict of interest. Cumis counsel takes its name from San Diego Navy Federal Credit Union v. Cumis Insurance Society, Inc., a 1984 court case in California that established the insureds right to independent counsel.","When an insurance company underwrites a new policy it not only agrees to protect the insured from losses, but also to defend the insured against any claims. The insurer is able to control the defense of the insured by selecting the defense counsel. In most cases this is permissible because both the insured and the insurer have the same interest which is defeating the claim or limiting the amount of losses that the claim can cause. In other cases, however, the interests of the insured and the insurer are not the same."
439,Cumulative Collusive Excess Cover,"Cumulative collusive excess cover refers to areinsurance contract in which losses over a predetermined limit are shared between the cedent and the reinsurance company. Cumulative collusive excess cover allows the cedent, which is the company that has purchased the reinsurance contact, to further reduce its exposure to a specific insured risk.","Insurance companies want to bring in as a high an amount of premiums as possible while limiting their exposure – often usingcumulative collusive excess cover – to the risks created when they underwrite new insurance policies. By reducing their risk exposure,they are reducing the likelihood of having to pay for a claim, while also providing more space to underwrite new policy. One way of reducing the risk exposure is by purchasing a reinsurance contract."
440,Cumulative Exposure,Cumulative exposure is exposure to a hazard over an extended period. Injury to the individual may not manifest itself until several years after the first exposure.  ,"Cumulative exposure is not immediately apparent, in contrast to most accidents and natural disasters. For example, when a home floods, the damage can be seen right away and insurance claims filed based on the evidence gathered at the scene. The same is true of car accidents, where vehicle damage and personal injuries are immediately evident."
441,Current Liquidity,"Current liquidity is the total amount of cash and unaffiliated holdings compared withnet liabilities and ceded reinsurance balances payable. Current liquidity is expressed as a percentage, and is used to determine the amount of an insurance companys liabilities that can be covered with liquid assets. A high ratio indicates that the insurer is not dependent on new premiums to cover existing liabilities.","Understanding the type of liabilities that an insurance company has taken on by underwriting policies and ceding reinsurance is an important step in determining whether an insurer is at risk. Insurers that are able to cover their liabilities with cash and other readily-available financial sources are better able to weather increases in claims, and are thus less reliant on underwriting new policies or increasing premiums in order to cover liabilities. This sort of analysis is called liquidity analysis."
442,Cut-Through Clause,"A cut-through clause is areinsurance contract provision that allows a party,other than the ceding company and reinsurance company, to have rights under the agreement. Cut-through clauses are often triggered by specific events, such as when a ceding company becomes insolvent.","The relationship between the ceding company and reinsurer changes when a cut-through clause is present.A reinsurance contract is made between a ceding company, such as an insurance company, and a reinsurance company. In exchange for a portion of the premiums generated by the ceding companys underwriting activities, the reinsurance company agrees to indemnify the ceding company from claims made. This contractual relationship is strictly between the ceding company and the reinsurer, not between parties not included in the contract, such as policyholders. However, this changes in the presence of a cut-through clause."
443,Dangerous Asset,"A dangerous asset is apiece of property or investment which poses a risk of liability to its owner. The term generally applies to a physical asset rather than a security. Such an asset might be a building, a vehicle or equipment.","A dangerous asset poses a threat to the physical safety of another unrelated individual, thus creating a potential liability to the assets owner. For instance, a bicycle rental firm that owns a bicycle with a wobbly tire and rents it to a customer is exposing itself to the risk that the customer has an accident caused by that defective equipment. Assuming that this causation can be proved, the rental company will likely be held liable for the renters injuries and will owe damages to the injured party."
444,Dean Analytic Schedule,The Dean Analytic Schedule is a method of rating commercial fire insurance policies based on various physical fire hazards.,"Originally published by (and named for) A.F. Dean in 1902, the Dean Analytic Schedule was the first predetermined insurance schedule. It assigned a rating to a given policy using thorough, qualitative analysis, taking all the possible physical factors (which can impact a fire hazard) into consideration."
445,Death Master File (DMF),The Death Master File (DMF) is a list of people whose deaths were reported to the Social Security Administration since 1962. It is important to realize the Death Master File contains only the death data of people who had Social Security numbers.,"The Social Security Administration (SSA) Death Master File contains more than 83 million records of deaths reported to the SSA. The Death Master File typically contains the Social Security number, name, date of birth and date of death."
446,Death Star IPO,"Death Star IPO is a company's highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) that becomes a blockbuster with investors. The Death Star IPO is a reference to the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station, also more popularly know as the ""Death Star,"" from the movie ""Star Wars."" This planetary weapon had the ability to destroy entire planets with a single beam, resulting in a massive explosion. In the stock market, stocks that have the ability to explode out of the gate are usually highly anticipated tech stocks, although stocks from other sectors can also fit the bill.","Broadly speaking, to be considered a Death Star IPO, the IPO would have to be a multi-billion dollar offering that is also in very high demand with investors. Some examples of Death Star IPOs include Google's IPO in 2004 and Yahoo! in 1996. Both IPOs were highly anticipated events and both stocks exploded on stock markets once the shares became publicly available."
447,Debris Removal Insurance,"Debris removal insurance is a section of a property insurance policy that provides reimbursement for clean-up costs associated with damage to a property. Policies with a debris removal provision typically only cover debris resulting from an insured peril, such as charred wood from a building fire.","Debris removal insurance policies commonly have a cap on the amount of reimbursement that a policyholder can receive for debris removal costs. While policies typically have debris removal as a standard provision, the policyholder is often able to purchase additional coverage.The policy provision may also extend to the removal of hazardous materials that may cover the property, but could exclude pollutants."
448,Declaratory Judgment,"A declaratory judgment is a court-issued judgment that defines and outlines the rights and obligations of each party in a contract.Declaratory judgments have the same effect and force as final judgments and are legally binding. These judgmentsarealso called a declaration, or declaratory relief.",Any party to a contract may petition the court to clarify its rights and obligations in the event of a legal controversy. A court-issued declaratory judgmentoutlines the rights and responsibilities of each involvedparty. This judgmentdoes not require action or award damages. It helps to resolve disputes and prevent lawsuits.
449,Decreasing Term Insurance,"Decreasing term insurance is renewable term life insurance with coverage decreasingover the life of the policyat a predetermined rate. Premiums are usually constant throughout the contract, and reductions in coverage typically occur monthly or annually. Terms range between 1 year and 30 years.","The theory behind decreasing term insurance holds thatwith age, certain liabilities and the corresponding need for high levels of insurance decreases. Numerous in-force decreasing term insurance policies take the form of mortgage life insurance, which affixes its benefit to the remaining mortgage of an insureds home. Alone, decreasing term insurance may not be sufficient for an individual's life insurance needs. Affordable standard term life insurance policies offer the security of a death benefit throughout the life of the contract."
450,Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC),"Typically used in the insurance industry, deferred acquisition costs (DAC)is when a company defers the sales costs that are associated with acquiring a new customer over the term of the insurance contract.",Most of the sales costs arise from referral commissions to external distributors and brokers.These are the costs to which deferred acquisition costs action canapply
451,Delay In Completion Coverage,Delay in completion coverage is insurance that protects against costs arising from a delayed construction project.,"Construction projects usually have set schedules for building all required structures and a time for completion for each building. However, construction doesnt always go according to plan or finish on time. A delayed completion sometimes causes construction companies, developers, and other parties to incur unexpected losses, none of which were in the original cost estimates. Delay in completion coverage is designed to protect against these additional expenses."
452,Demolition Insurance,"Demolition insurance that is used to cover the costs of demolishing a building that is damaged by a peril, such as a fire or storm. Zoning requirements or building codes may require that a damaged building be demolished rather than repaired. Demolition insurance covers the cost of tearing down undamaged portions of a damaged structure.","Demolition insurance covers a building that is damaged, not necessarily pieces of a building that may cover the property itself after a storm or other peril. Property owners should also check their property insurance policies for a debris removal provision, which covers the cost of removing debris and pollution that may result from demolition."
453,Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF),The Deposit Insurance Fundis devoted to insuring the deposits of individuals covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is set aside to pay back the money lost due to the failure of a financial institution.The DIF is funded by insurance payments made bybanks.,"Account holders at banks feel more secure if their deposits are insured, and the Deposit Insurance Fund provides the assurance they are. For example, if your bank closed its doors in 2009, you would be covered up to $250,000. This reduces the same type of fear that caused the bank run in the 1930s. A common use of the DIF account balanceis to compare it to the total assets of banks on the ""FDIC Problem Banks List,"" which is issued quarterly. The FDIC could not run out of money because it could borrow from the Treasury Department, but large losses would mean higher premiums for the remaining banks in the following years."
454,Developed Premium,A developed premium is an initial quote from an insurer based largely on the policyholders risk profile.,"A developed premium quote is often adjusted once the insurer receives more information about the potential policyholder. At first, insurers have only the most basic details about those looking for a quote on a policy until the individual or business offers more in-depth details. Insurers will generally determine the initial insurance premium quote, estimating using an average policyholders risk profileand later alter the estimate using experience modifiers."
455,Developed To Net Premiums Earned,"The ratio of developed premiums to net premiums earned over a given time period. Developed to net premiums earned is a ratio that indicates whether an insurance company is charging high enough premiums to cover benefits guaranteed by the policies it writes, referred to as its loss reserves.","Insurance companies have to balance the premiums they bring in by writing policies with the benefits that those policies are guaranteeing. They set aside required reserves in order to ensure that they have enough money to pay for future claims, with any money left over after creating a reserve considered to be profit. Insurance companies want to make sure that their loss reserve is enough to cover its liabilities, but not too large so as to limit opportunities for using premiums to bring in more revenue through investment activities."
456,Development To Policyholder Surplus,"Development to policyholder surplus is the ratio of an insurers loss reserve development to its policyholder surplus. The development to policyholder surplus ratio shows whether a company is setting aside an appropriate amount of funds as loss reserves, and whether its policyholder surplus (an insurance companys net worth) is overstated or understated.","The development to policyholders surplus ratio is often calculated over multiple time periods in order to see whether an insurer is consistently overstating or understating its reserves. If the development to policyholders surplus ratio is increasing from year to year, it may be an indication of the insurance company intentionally strengthening its loss reserves (overstating), while a decrease in the ratio may indicate that its reserves are being understated."
457,Difference In Conditions (DIC) Insurance,"Difference in conditions (DIC) insurance isa type ofpolicy that provides expanded coverage for some perils not covered by standard insurance policies. DIC insurance is designed to fill in gaps in insurance coverageand is most frequently used by larger organizations, looking for protection from catastrophic perils.","Difference in conditionsinsuranceprovides expanded coverage forperilsnot covered by standard insurance policies.Insurance companies typically offer policies that cover perils that are well-defined and predictable. They are less willing to underwrite policies that cover infrequent and severe perils, as these are more difficult to account when setting the premium thatshould charged. Thus, most policies cover higher frequency, lower severity perils. However, this does not meanthat the insured party is fully insulated fromrisks ofcatastrophes. Itdoes mean that many insurers shy away from providing coverage for catastrophes."
458,Direct Premiums Written,Direct premiums written arethe totalpremiums received before consideringreinsurance ceded. Direct premiums writtenrepresent the growth of a companys insurance business during a given period. It can include both policies written by the company and policies written by its affiliated companies.,"While insurance companies can increase revenue by increasing premiums on policies that have come upfor renewal, the main driver for growth in this area is writing new policies. Direct written premiums show how many new premiums were written over the course of the year, even if those premiums are ultimately not collected."
459,Direct Writer,"A direct writer is aninsurance agent or insurance company that only issues insurance policies from a single insurance company. A direct writer, also called a captive agent, represents a single company and does not shop around at several companies to find a client the best policy for the best price. Most of the insurance companies that are household names are direct writers.","Direct writers are employees of a single insurance company, whereas independent agents are self-employed and make money from the commissions they receive from various insurance companies when they sell insurance policies. Consumers do not pay independent agents a fee for the service they provide."
460,Directors And Officers Liability Insurance,Directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance is insurance coverage intended to protect individuals from personal losses if they are sued as a result of serving as a director or an officer of a business or other type of organization (see Build A Wall Around Your Assets). It can also cover the legal fees and other costs the organization may incur as a result of such a suit. ,"Directors and officersliability insurance applies to anyone who serves as a director or an officer of a for-profit business or non-profit organization. A directors and officers liability policy insuresagainst personal losses, and itcan also help reimburse abusiness or nonprofit for the legal fees or other costs incurred in defending suchindividuals against a lawsuit."
461,Disability Insurance,"Disability insurance is a type of insurance tha twill provide income in the event a worker is unable to perform their work and earn money due to a disability. There are many types of organizations that provide different types ofdisability insurance. Each organization and disability insurance type have specific rules as to what constitutes a disability and how a person might qualify to receive the disability benefit. Short term disability insurance policies offer a worker a portion of their salary if they are unable to work for a short period- typically three to six months. Long term disability insurance offers a worker a portion of their salary if they are unable to work for a longer period- typically a period of over six months. Both short term and long term disability policies have a period that a person must be disabled for before that individual is able to start receiving disability benefits. That period of time is called an elimination period. If a person becomes disabled, they must wait until the elimination period is over before they start receiving benefits. If they are able to work before the elimination period is over, the person will not receive a benefit. The Social Security Administrationalso provides disability insurance. Employees who've paid the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax for a certain amount of time, are eligible to receive the Social Security disability income insurance if they meet the strict requirements of disability under the OASDIprogram.",Disability insurance is also referred to as disability-income insurance.
462,Disability Insurance Trust Fund,"The Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI) is the smaller of two funds within the Social Security Trust Fund, established as part of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1956. The vital Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI) is the second and more massiveTrust.",The Disability Fund pays Social Security benefits to those who are mentally or physically incapable of gainful employment. Spouses and children of recipients may also receive benefits.
463,Disability-Income (DI) Insurance,Disability income (DI) insurance provides supplementary income in the event of an illness or accident resulting in a disability that prevents the insured from working at their regular employment. Benefits usually are paid monthly so the insured can maintain their standard of living and continue to pay ordinary expenses.,​​​​​​​Disability income (DI)insurance is designed to replace between 45% and 65% of the insureds gross incomeon a tax-free basis. The benefits tax-free because the individual used after-tax dollars to pay for the plan.The policy pays a benefit in the event illness or injury prevents the policyholder from earning their usual income in their occupation.
464,Discounted Stop-Loss Cover,Discounted stop-loss cover is areinsurance agreement used by self-insured companies to cover losses over a predetermined retention level. Discounted stop-loss covers are purchased at a reduced rate by self-insured companies who use the same vendor for other administrative functions.,"When considering discounted stop-loss covers, self-insured companies have to consider whether the financial benefits and convenience of working with a single provider outweighs paying a higher rate for stop-loss coverage and working with several different companies that may be more specialized in providing administrative services. If a self-insured companys risk profile is low, it may not make sense to purchase stop loss coverage."
465,Discovery Bond,"A discovery bond is a type of fidelity bond used to protect a business from losses caused by employees committing acts of fraud. A discovery bond covers losses that are discovered while the bond is in effect, regardless of when the fraudulent or dishonest acts were committed.","While its name implies that it is a bond, a discovery bond is actually an insurance policy and not a security that can be traded."
466,Discovery Cover,"A discovery cover is a provision in an insurance policy that indemnifies the policyholder for losses that are found during the policy period, regardless of when the losses actually occurred. Discovery covers are used in both insurance policies and reinsurance treaties, and are designed to provide protection from claims that are filed after a prolonged period of time.","A reinsurance treaty with a discovery cover is akin to a claims-made policy for insurers. It allows the ceding insurer to be indemnified by the reinsurer from losses that were discovered while the treaty was in effect, regardless of when the loss was sustained."
467,Disease Management Program,A disease management program is an initiative created and managed by a health insurance company to manage the costs of policyholders chronic health conditions. It is based on the idea of spending a relatively low impact now to prevent or minimize health problems to lessen potential costs and related claims in the future.,A disease management program can help control health care expenses for insurance companies and employers who offer health insurance.
468,Distribution Clause,A distribution clause is a term used in the insurance industry that refers to a specific provision in an insurance policy that defines coverage limits for multiple risks.,"A distribution clause is a provision which determines how the coverage limit is to be applied to items covered under the policy. Distribution clauses apply to policies that cover multiple assets, such as property insurance, including assets that are spread out over multiple locations. Home insurance is a type of blanket insurance, as it covers both the structure and the contents of your house against loss."
469,Doctrine Of Utmost Good Faith,"The Doctrine of Utmost Good Faith, also known as uberrimae fidei, is the minimum standard requiring transacting parties to act honestly and not mislead or withhold critical information from one another. The doctrine of utmost good faith applies to many everyday financial transactions and is one of the most fundamental doctrines in insurance law.","In the insurance market, the principle of utmost good faith requires the applicant to disclose all relevant personal information, such as previous health problems. Likewise, the insurance agent must reveal critical details about the contract and its terms. Unlike insurance contracts, most commercial agreements do not subscribe to the doctrine of utmost good faith.Instead, most are subject to caveat emptor, or ""buyer beware.""A sellerneed only disclose information requested by the buyer."
470,Double Gearing,"Double gearing describes situations where more than one company use shared capitalas a way tomitigate risk. The businesses involved in double gearing loan funds to one another. This practice can artificially skew the accounts of the companies, making them appear in better financial health than theyare. This practice is common incomplex corporate structures, where one large company owns various subsidiaries, each maintaining a separatebalance sheet. Those individual balance sheets may appear to show adequate capital, but if analyzed as one entity may revealoverleveragedpositions. ",Double gearing is a practice that can disguise risk exposure because more than one business entity may claim the same assets as capital protecting against risk.Sharing seems to be a way that helps tomitigate risk but does not adequately document the actual exposure to risk for each company.
471,Dram Shop Laws,"Dram shop laws are laws that hold businesses liable when they serve or sell alcohol to minors or obviously intoxicated persons who later cause death or injury. Dram shop laws vary by state. States hold establishments liable incertain circumstances, and to varyingdegrees, depending on the lawapproved by the voters of the state.","The dram shop law gets its name from a historicalway of measuring alcohol where a dram is .75 of a teaspoon. The regulation applies to all businesses that sell or serve alcohol. Such establishments include restaurants, bars, liquor stores, taverns, and stadium vendors."
472,Dread Disease Rider,"A dread disease rider is a unique addition to alife insurancepolicy. The rider provides the policyholder a percentage of thedeath benefitfor diagnoses of severe diseases. Diseases include, but are not confined to, cancer, kidney failure, organ transplant, or myocardiumheart disease.",A dread disease rider will usually expire when the holder reaches age 65 and specifies which illnesses the policy will cover. This coverage is also known as catastrophic or critical illness coverage.​​​​​​​
473,Early Warning Tests,Early warning tests are a series of financial ratios and other performance criteria used to identify insurance companies that may require additional monitoring by state insurance regulators. Early warning tests are designed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and help regulators reduce the risk of insurance companies becoming insolvent.,"Early warning tests are used to identifyfailing insurance companies before they become a problem for their customers and other interests.Insurance companies are primarily regulated by state agencies rather than the federal government, and regulations may vary from state to state. Despite the varying regulations, all states have a common interest: limiting the possibility that an insurance company will become insolvent. This is for several reasons. First, insolvent insurers cannot pay claims made by policyholders, which hurts consumers and businesses that have experienced losses. Second, a few failing insurers can erode confidence in the wider insurance industry. Third, state regulators may be forced to step in and use resources to wind down the insurer."
474,Earned Premium,"Earned premium is a pro-rated amount of paid-in-advance premiums that has been ""earned"" and now belongs to the insurer. The amount of theearned premium equates to the sum of thetotal premiums collected by an insurance company over a period of time.In other words, theearned premiumis the portion of an insurance premium that paid for a portion of time in whichthe insurance policy was in effect, but has now passed andexpired. Since the insurance company covered the risk during that time, itcannow consider the associated premium payments it took from the insured as""earned.""","The premium that a policyholder pays for an insurance contract is not immediately recognized as earnings by the insurer. While the policyholder has met his or her obligation by paying for the policyand, thus, the benefits that he or she could receive, an insurer has only just begun its obligation when it receives the premium. When the premium is first received, it is considered an unearned premium, notprofit. As time passes, however, the insurer incrementally changes the status of the premium fromunearned toearned.Until the policy end date is reached, the insurer is responsible for any claims made, and only when that date is reached will the entirety of the premium be considered profit."
475,Elimination Period,"An elimination period is the length of time between when an injury or illness begins and receiving benefit payments from an insurer. Also known as the ""waiting"" or ""qualifying"" period, policyholders must, in the interim, pay for these services. The resulting effect canbe thought of as a deductible.","In general, the shorter the elimination period, the more expensive the policy and vice versa. Typically, most insurance policies have the best premium rates for 90-day elimination periods. A policy with anything longer than 90 days, while less expensive, may not save you much compared to the extra risk you take on."
476,Employer's Liability Insurance,"Employer's liability insurance protects employers from financial loss if a worker has a job-related injury or illness not covered by workers' compensation. Employer's liability insurance can be packaged with workers' compensation insurance to further protect companies against the costs associated with workplace injuries, illnesses and deaths notcovered under workers' compensation. Employer's liability insurance is also calledpart 2 of a workers compensation policy.","Most employees are covered by workers' compensation lawsestablished at the state level (federal employees work under federal workers' compensation laws). States require most employers to carry workers' compensation insurance, which provides some level of coverage formedical expenses and lost wages experiencedby employees, or their beneficiaries, when an employee is injured, sickened or killed by job-related causes. There is no need for the employee to sue the employer to establish fault in order to qualify for workers compensation. However, if an employee feels that workers' compensation doesn't adequately covers their loss—perhaps because they feel their employers negligence caused their injury— they may decide to sue their employer forpunitive damages, such aspain and suffering. Employers liability coverage is designed to cover these types of expenses, which arent covered by workers' compensation or bygeneral liability insurance. In the event of a payout under an employer's liability insurance policy, an employer can help limit theirlosses by including, as a condition of thepayout, a clause that releases the employer and their insurance company from further liability related to the incident in question."
477,Employment Insurance (EI),"Employment Insurance (EI) is an unemployment insurance program in Canada that allows individuals who have recently lost a job to receive temporary financial assistance. Employment insurance can also be extended to individuals who are unable to work because of illness or who are caring for a young child or a seriously ill family member. In additional to financial assistance, the program assists the unemployed with job search services.","The Employment Insurance Act replaced the Unemployment Insurance Act in 1996. The updated scheme was designed to link unemployment benefits with wagesand to reduce penalties for those who couldonly find temporary work. In order to qualify for benefits, individuals must work a certain number of hours, and the length of time for whichbenefits are provideddepends on an individual's geographic region's unemployment rate.Employers contribute 1.4 times the amount of employee premiums. Since 1990, there has been nogovernment contribution to this fund. The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area."
478,Endorsement,"Endorsement is a term that has various definitions depending on the context ofits use. For example, a signature authorizing the legal transfer of a negotiable instrument between parties is an endorsement. Endorsements can be an amendment to a contract or document such as a life insurance policy or a driver's license. Apublic declaration of support for a person, product, or service is also an endorsement.","When an employer signs a payroll check, it authorizes or endorses the transfer of money from the business account to the employee. The act of signing the check is considered an endorsement, which serves as proof of the payer's intent to transfer funds to the payee."
479,Entity-Purchase Agreement,"An entity-purchase agreement is atype of business succession planused by companies that have more than one owner. The plan involves having the company take out an insurance policy on the lives of owners in the amount equal to each owner's interest. In the event of death, the amount collected by the company from the insurance, which is equal to the deceased owners stake, is used to pay the deceased's estate for its share of the business.","The advantage of an entity-purchase agreement-basedsuccession plan is that the owners know their respective stakes in the company will be paid out to their estates, and that the company will continue to be run by the other partners. Having this type of succession plan, (which is paid for by the company) allows the owners to avoid any out-of-pocket expenses while also looking after their families in the event of death.When the entity in question is a corporation, anentity-purchase agreement may be referred toas a stock redemptionagreement.In such cases, the business itself will enter into an agreement with each owner to purchase a deceased owners business interest. The agreement requires that adeceased owners estatesell the business interest and that the business entity must buy the deceased owners business interest. The agreement also establishesthe price to be paid either based on a fixed amount or a formula."
480,Equalization Reserve,Equalization reserve is a long-term reserve that an insurance company keeps to prevent cash-flow depletion in case of significant unforeseen catastrophe.,"A disastrous event such as a flood, earthquake, or fire can result in the severe depletion of an insurance company's equalization reserve. These reserves could be seen as the company's personal ""rainy day fund,"" compensating for unforeseen and often expensive events.For example, a massive stormhits an area where an insurer has insured a number of properties; the large number of losses requires the firm to access its equalization reserve. Flooding, fires, and tornadoes may cause similarly large losses."
481,Equitable Subrogation,"Equitable subrogation is a legal doctrine that allows a party that has made payments on behalf of another party to lay claim to the recovery of damages or funds from a third-party. Equitablesubrogationis a legal concept that allows one party to replace another party when it comes to a legal right. It is most commonly associated with the insurance industry, specifically in relation to the settlement of claims.","Equitable subrogation is considered equitable because one party pays the obligation of another party. The party that pays the obligation is referred to as the subrogee, and the party that has its obligation paid is called the subrogor."
482,Equity-Indexed Universal Life Insurance,Equity-indexed universal life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance policy that ties its accumulation to a stock market index.,"Equity-indexed universal life insurance, like all universal life insurance, builds a cash value that the insured can borrow against, invest with and use to cover increases in the cost of insurance, potentially eliminating out-of-pocket premium payments should the cash value overtake increases in the costs of insurance."
483,Equivalent Flat Rate,The equivalent flat rate is the price at which a guarantee scheme for flat-rate insurance costs the same as a guarantee scheme for risk-based insurance.,Insurance guarantee schemes (IGS) are part of insurance regulations in Europe. They protect policyholders as a last resort when an insurer cannot cover a claim due to its own insolvency.
484,Escalator Pitch,"An escalator pitch is a slang term used to describe the quick delivery of a presentation outlining an idea for a product, service or project. The name comes from the notion that the pitch should be succinct enough to be delivered to another party while riding an escalator. An escalator pitch should last no more than 60 seconds. Also known as an elevator pitch.","Entrepreneurs use escalator pitches to convince venture capital firms to invest in their ideas. Because there are many business opportunities from which to choose, an entrepreneur has to be able to clearly and effectively explain an idea if an opportunity presents itself with a potential investor."
485,Essential Health Benefits,Essential health benefits is a term used in the insurance industry that refers to certain benefits that must be included in certain health insurance plans.,
486,European Life Settlement Association - ELSA,The European Life Settlement Association (ELSA) promotes fair standards for the European life settlement industry.Its ultimate goal is the promotion and marketing of the life settlement industry across the European continent.,"The European Life Settlement Association (ELSA) is a membership organization providing its members with many benefits including access to proprietary research and white papers, plus attendance at its annual symposium. A life settlement transpires when a life insurance policy holder sells the value of the policy to a third party."
487,European Medicines Agency (EMA),"European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a centralized government body whose goal is to promote and protect human and animal health through overseeing the use of medications in European countries. The EMA, formerly called the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, is the European Unions equivalent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The EMA is sometimes called the European Medicines Evaluation Agency or EMEA, although this is not its official name.","European Medicines Agency (EMA) originated in London in 1995. It serves a population of more than 500 million people in the European Union. The EMAs mission is to protect the health and well-being of both people and animals living throughout the 28 EU member states, along with those in the countries located in the European Economic Area, or EEA. One of the agencys primary priorities is to provide critical new medications to the patients who need them in a timely manner."
488,Ex Gratia Payment,"An ex gratiapaymentis made to an individual by an organization, government, or insurer for damages or claims, but itdoes not requirethe admittance of liability by the party making the payment. An ex gratia payment is considered voluntary, as the party making the payment is not obligated to compensate the individual. In Latin,ex gratia meansfrom favor.","Ex gratia payments differ from legally mandated payments in that they are made voluntarily.Organizations, governmentsand insurers will typically provide compensation to victims only if they are legally required to do so. In the case of an insurance company, if a policyholder suffers an injury that is covered by the terms of the insurance policy, the insurer is obligated to pay. This type of payment is not voluntary. Itis the result of a legal obligation, and it typically carries with it an admission of liability."
489,Excess Judgment Loss,Excess judgment loss is the amount of additional loss that an insurer is required to pay above the policy limit. This is often due to actions on the part of the insurance company that are found to be in violation of good business practices.,Excess judgment loss is awarded by a judge if it is found that the insurance company acted in bad faith when settling a claim. Insurance companies can act in bad faith in a variety of ways. They may use unreasonable or illegitimate ground to deny coverage or refuse to pay claims. They may deliberately slow the process of investigating claims or paying damages. Or they may raise baseless objections as an excuse to deny claims.
490,Excess Limits Premium,"Excess limits premium,commonly found in casualty reinsurance contracts, is the amount paid for coverage beyond the basic liability limits found in an insurance contract.","In an insurance contract, the insured party purchases a predefined amount of coverage against a specific type of risk from the insurer. Once the policyholder reaches the coverage limit, the insurer is no longer responsible for covering losses. Coverage limitations can create a scenario in which the loss from a risk exceeds the amount of coverage. The result is the insured potentially has to cover a significant portion of the remaining losses out of pocket."
491,Excess Of Loss Reinsurance,"Excess of loss reinsurance is a type of reinsurance in which the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company for losses that exceed a specified limit. Excess of loss reinsurance is a form of non-proportional reinsurance. Depending on the language of the contract, it can apply to eitherall loss events during the policy period orlosses in aggregate. Treaties may also use bands of losses that are reduced with each claim.","Treaty or facultative reinsurance contracts often specify a limit in losses for whichthe reinsurer will be responsible. This limit is agreed to in the reinsurance contract, and protects the reinsurance company from dealing with an unlimited liability. In this way, treaty and facultative reinsurance contracts aresimilar to a standard insurance contract, which provides coverage up to a specific amount. While this is beneficial to the reinsurer, it places the onus on the insurance company to reduce losses."
492,Excess of Line Reinsurance,Excess of line reinsurance is a type of reinsurance policy offered by companies that are not registered to do business directly within a state's borders. Excess of line reinsurance can be sold by carriers who are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as policies sold by state-licensed carriers. This insurance isalso known as excess or surplus lines insurance.,"In the United States, individual states regulate the sale of insurance products within their borders. To sell insurance in a state, a standard insurance company, known as an admitted carrier, must comply with the state's insurance regulations. State regulations may include how an insurerreports financial information, the construction of policy provisions, how theydeal with insolvency, and how the company establishes rates."
493,Expected Loss Ratio (ELR) Method,"Expected loss ratio (ELR) method is atechnique used to determine the projected amount of claims, relative to earned premiums. The expected loss ratio (ELR) method is used when an insurer lacks the appropriate past claims occurrence data to provide because of changes to its product offerings and when it lacks a large enough sample of data for long-tail product lines.",Insurers set aside a portion of their premiums fromunderwriting new policies in order to pay for future claims. Expected loss ratiois used to determine how much they set aside. It's also important to note that thefrequency and severity of the claims they expect to experience also plays a role. Insurers use variety offorecasting methods in order to determineclaims reserves.
494,Expense Constant,"An expense constant is a fixed amount added to an insurance policy to cover the cost of administering the policy. Workers compensation policies use expense constants most frequently, though other types of low premium policies also use them.","For most types of insurance, policyholder premiums cover the insurance companys own expenses while ensuring that the company has enough funds to cover any claims against its policyholders. For policies such as workers compensation, insurance companies charge an expense constant to cover their own costs when premiums do not suffice."
495,Experience Rating (Insurance),Experience rating (insurance) is the amount of loss that an insured party experiences compared to the amount of loss that similar insureds experience. Experience rating is most commonly associated with workers compensation insurance. It is used to calculate the experience modification factor.,"Experience rating (insurance) is the amount of loss that an insured party experiences compared to the amount of loss that similar insureds experience.Insurance companies closely monitor the claims and losses that come from the policies that they underwrite. This evaluation includes determining whether certain classes of policyholders are more prone to claims, and are thus more risky to insure."
496,Experience Refund,"Experience refund is the portion of an insurance companys premiums or profits that is returned to the policyholder if the insurers loss experience is better than expected. An experience refund is provided to a policyholder by the insurer, or to a ceding insurer by a reinsurer.","When an insurer sells an insurance policy, and the insured costs the insurer less than expected, they might offer an experience refund, which is thereturn part of the profits they made from the policy.When an insurance company underwrites a new policy, it makes a series of estimations in order to determine how much to charge for coverage. It examines the type of peril being insured against, the risk profile of the policyholder, and the potential severity and frequency of claims. An insurers profitability is directly linked to the difference between the amount of premiums charged for coverage and the amount of losses resulting from claims against a policy, and the insurer has an incentive to both maximize premiums and minimize losses."
497,Exposure Rating,Exposure rating is a procedure used by reinsurers to calculate risk exposure in a reinsurance treaty. The reinsurer does not need previous exposure to underwritingthespecific risk. The exposure rating method is one of two risk calculations used in the insurance industry. The second method is called the experience rating method.,"When developing thereinsurance treatyprice, the reinsurer estimates the likelihood that a loss will exceed the damage amount retained by the ceding company. Reinsurers may also execute an excess of loss reinsurance treaty, in which the reinsurer agrees to pay for losses above the specific amount retained by the ceding company. Excess of loss treaties may also cap the damagesfor which the reinsurer is responsible. Both reinsurance treaties require the reinsurer to estimate the frequency and severity of claims, creating a general risk profile that they may use when setting the treaty price."
498,Exposure Trigger,Exposure Trigger is an event that causes a policyholders insurance coverage to kick in. This is one of four triggers of coverage that determines when an injury or damage covered by an insurance policy occurred and whether the policy will pay for a related claim. The exposure trigger commonly applies in lawsuits claiming bodily harm because of the plaintiffs exposure to a hazardous substance.,"It is often difficult to determine the specific time period when someone was harmed by a substance and who should be held responsible. Thats where the exposure trigger comes in. According to the International Risk Management Institute, the most common use of the exposure trigger is in asbestos lawsuits. In these cases, exposure is defined as the first time the plaintiff was exposed to and inhaled asbestos fibers."
499,Extra Expense Insurance,Extra expense insurance provides funds for reasonable and necessary costs a business may incur in the event that business operations are interrupted. Extra expense insurance coverage applies to the period of time between when a business is forced to temporarily close and when it has been restored to normal operation.,"Extra expense insurance is designed to cover a business from expenses that it may incur while normal business operations are disrupted. These expenses are often excluded from other insurance policies, such as property insurance, which are designed to cover physical damage resulting from specific perils. Types of expenses that are covered under an extra expense insurance policy have to be considered reasonable and necessary, such as the cost of setting up a temporary office while the damaged office is being repaired."
500,Extra-Contractual Obligations (ECO) Clause,"An extra-contractual obligations (ECO)clause in a reinsurance contract requiresa reinsurer to pay for expenses imposed upon the ceding insurer by regulatory, judicial, or governmental organizations. An extra-contractual obligation (ECO) clause specifically applies to losses that are outside of the insurance policies covered under a reinsurance treaty.","Extra-contractualdamages are awarded in ""bad faith"" claims against insurance companies. They are a form of punitive damages, intended to punish extreme insurer conduct.Extra-contractual obligations differ from excess of policy limits (XPL) losses. Excess of policy limits losses refer to those that result from an insurer mishandling an insurance claim, and finding itself liable for the losses above the policy limit. Extra-contractual obligations are not the result of mishandling a claim, and instead are the result of negligence, bad faithor deceptive practices. For example, an insurer may be found to have engaged in deceptive sales practices, and be sued by a policyholder for misrepresenting what perils are covered by the policy."
501,Extraction Factor,"The extraction factor is the portion of an insurance companys subjectpremiumthat is deducted from what is owed to areinsurancecompany under the terms of a reinsurance treaty. The extraction factor is typically calculated as a percentage, and it is used to adjust the amount owed by the reinsured party based on the policies that are and are not covered under the reinsurance treaty.","Extraction factor is a term relevant to the agreement between an insurance company and a reinsurance company. Insurance companies sometimes usereinsurance as arisk managementtool. Through this agreement, an insurance company cedes some of its risk exposure to a reinsurance company. The reinsurer in turn provides protection to the insurer."
502,FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA),"The FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) was passed in 1991 at the height of the savings and loan crisis,anditfortified the FDIC's role and resources in protecting consumers. The most notable provisions of the act raised the FDIC's U.S. Treasury line of credit from $5 million to $30 million, revamped the FDIC auditing and evaluation standards of member banks, and created the Truth in Savings Act (Regulation DD).","While it may be hard to fully appreciate the changes made to the internal workings of the FDIC through the The FDIC Improvement Act, most consumers can agree that the Truth in Savings Act has gone a long way towards forcing banks to deliver on their advertised promises.The Truth in Savings Act, which was part of the FDICIA,forced banks to begin disclosing savings account interest rates, using the uniform annual percentage yield (APY) method. This has helped consumers to better understand their potential return on a deposit at a bank, as well as to compare multiple products and multiple banks simultaenously."
503,Facultative Reinsurance,"Facultative reinsurance is purchased by a primary insurer to cover a single risk or a block of risks held in the primary insurer's book of business.Facultative reinsurance is one of the two types of reinsurance, with the other type being treaty reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance is considered to be more of a one-off transactional dealwhiletreaty reinsurance is more of a long-term arrangement.","An insurance companythat enters into a reinsurance contract with a reinsurance company, also knownas a ceding company, does so in order to pass off some of their riskin exchange for a fee. Thisfee may be a portion of the premium the insurer receives for apolicy. The primary insurerthat cedes risk to the reinsurer has the option of ceding specific risks or a block of risks. Reinsurance contract types determine whether the reinsureris able to accept or reject an individual risk, or if the reinsurer must accept all risks."
504,Fake Claims,"The term fake claims refers to insurance claims that are made fraudulently. These claims are made in an attempt for the policy holder to benefit financially from making claims that are false or exaggerated. While such practices are a fairly common occurrence, they are highly illegal.","Fake claims are often exaggerations of valid claims to an insurance policy. For example, a homeowner insurance policy holder may have been the victim of a breaking and entering where items were stolen. The number (and value) of the stolen items may be exaggerated on the claims report, indicating that more items were stolen than really were. This exaggeration could lead to the homeowner receiving a larger claim settlement than they aretruly entitled. Large claims are often investigated to mitigate such problems."
505,Family Income Rider,"A family income rider is anaddition to a life insurance policy that provides the beneficiary with an amount of money equal to the policyholder's monthly income if the policyholder dies. A family income rider is a type of death benefit, and it specifies the term for the additional coverage. It eventually expires if not activated.","In some cases, the beneficiary of a family income ridermay choose a lump sum rather than receiving monthly payments. Younger wage-earners will typically choose a longer length of time for coverage because they have more working years left before retirement, and would therefore cause a larger financial hardship to their families if they died."
506,Federal Housing Administration (FHA),"The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a U.S. agency offering mortgage insurance toFHA-approvedlenders that meet specific qualifications. Mortgage insurance protects lenders against losses from mortgage defaults. If a borrower defaults on a loan, the FHA pays the lender a specified claim amount.","The primary goal of establishing the FHA is to stimulatethe housing industry. The underlying idea was that by providing insurance to lenders, more individuals, or customers, would qualify for mortgages to buy homes. Most FHA loans are for individuals who could not afford, and would not ordinarily qualify for, a traditional home mortgage loan."
507,Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA),"The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is a U.S. law that creates a payroll tax requiring a deduction from the paychecks of employees as well as a contribution from employers to fund the Social Security and Medicare programs. For self-employed persons, there is an equivalent law called the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA).","Social Security and Medicare are U.S. social programs that provide benefits for retirees, people with disabilities, and beneficiaries of said workers. Social Security helps retired people, people with disabilities, and families of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 years and older and others with specific conditions."
508,Federal Insurance Office - FIO,The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) advises the United States Treasury Department and other agencies within the federal government oninsurance matters.,"The Federal Insurance Office was created in 2010, and born out of Title V of the Federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The director of the FIO is appointed by the secretary of the Treasury. The FIOworks closely with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The department has no regulatory authority andserves purely in an advisory capacity."
509,Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program,"The federal-state unemployment compensation program is a social safety net that provides temporary financial assistance to workers whose employment has been terminated through no fault of their own. It is most commonly available to people who have been laid off due to company restructuring, downsizing or the cessation of operations.","The federal-state unemployment compensation program is a federal fund, but each state has its own unemployment program with its own qualification guidelines, benefit amounts and periods. The state programs operate based on federal laws. These benefits can sometimes be referred to as unemployment."
510,File-And-Use Rating Laws,"File-and-use rating laws areinsurance regulations allowing an insurance company to use new rates prior to receiving state approval. File-and-use rating laws allow the insurer to immediately use the new rates, with the insurance regulator having the option to strike down any rate change if it determines that the change cannot be justified.","Insurance is regulated on a state level, and states use different mechanisms to regulate the rates that insurance companies are allowed to charge consumers. Regulators balance an insurers need to remain solvent by offering policies that bring in enough premiums relative to promised benefits while ensuring that consumers are offered fairly priced policies. This means that state insurance regulators monitor and approve rates."
511,Financial Guarantee,A financial guarantee is a non-cancellable indemnity bond backed by an insurer to guarantee investors that principal and interest payments will be made.Many insurance companies specialize in financial guarantees and similar products that are used by debt issuers as a way of attracting investors. The guarantee provides investors with an additional level of comfort that the investment will be repaid in the event that the securities issuer would not be able to fulfill the contractual obligation to make timely payments. It also lowers the cost of financing for issuers because the guarantee typically earns the security a higher credit rating and therefore lower interest rates.,"Most bonds are insured by a financial guaranteefirm (also referred to as a monoline insurer) against default. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 hit financial guarantee firms particularly hard. It left numerous financial guarantors with billions of dollars of obligations to repay on mortgage-related securities that defaulted, and it caused firms to have their credit ratings slashed."
512,"Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery And Enforcement Act","The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery And Enforcement Act (FIRREA)was enacted to ensure that real estate appraisals areperformed up to standard.This includes regulation on the competency of the appraisers, supervisory standards and accurate and full documentation. TheFIRREA also holds claim to the creation of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the restructuring of the regulation authority, the abolishment of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and the creation of the Savings Association Insurance Fund and the Bank Insurance Fund.","The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery And Enforcement Act (FIRREA) was enacted in 1989, following the savings and loan crisis. Its purpose was to create a more efficient, productive and effective base on which to build the industry and better serve as a safeguard for future transactions. It resulted indramaticchanges tothe savings and loan industry and its federalregulation, including deposit insurance. Changes included the following:"
513,Financial Quota Share,"A financial quota share is areinsurance treaty in which the ceding company is responsible for a portion of the loss associated with a claim. Financial quota shares do not require the ceding company to pay a deductible before coverage begins, as the company will always be responsible for a portion of the loss.Companies, including insurers, often treat reinsurance as a form of capital. This is because a reinsurance treaty allows a ceding company to shift a portion of its risk off of its balance sheet and onto the reinsurer's, thus reducing the amount of capital it may have to employ in the case of a claim.","There are two types of reinsurance: excess of loss and quota share. Excess of loss reinsurance is considered non-proportional, as the amount of claim paid by the reinsurer and the ceding company is dependent on the claim severity. Quota share reinsurance is considered proportional, with the ceding company and reinsurer covering the same amount of claim regardless of its severity. A company choosing between these two types of coverage would have to weigh the likelihood of a high severity claim, as high severity claims are more likely to make excess of loss coverage more economical."
514,Financial Responsibility Clause,A provision within an automobile insurance policy which indicates that the policy holder has the minimum amount of coverage required by the state that he or she is driving in. Financial responsibility clauses are used to ensure that the driver has the coverage specified by the financial responsibility laws.,"Because different states may have different minimum coverage requirements, financial responsibility clauses reduce ambiguity by stating the policy holder always meets that requirement. For example, a driver is required to have at least $20,000 in liability coverage in the state that his car is registered in. While on a business trip, the driver passes through a state with a higher requirement: $30,000. Because the driver's policy has a financial liability clause, as soon as the driver enters the state with a higher requirement, his coverage moves from $20,000 to $30,000."
515,Financial Services Agency - FSA ,"Financial Services Agency, or FSA, is a Japanese government entity responsible for overseeing banking, insurance and securities and exchange.","The role of the Financial Services Agency is to ensure the stability of Japan's financial system; the protection of depositors, insurance policyholders and securities investors. It is in charge of the inspection, supervision and transparency of the financial system through the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission. It also oversees the country's Certified Public Accountants and Auditing Oversight Board."
516,Financing Entity,"A financing entity is the party in a financing arrangement that provides money, property, or another asset to an intermediate entity or financed entity. A financing entity receives a fee for providing financingand is linked to the financed entity through a chain of financing transactions across all intermediaries.","Financing entities and financed entities represent the two major parties in a financing arrangement. A financing entity provides money that is used by the financed entity. Other entities may serve as intermediaries. The financing entity can borrow the money from a bank or other financial institution using assets as collateral. For example, a business maysell its inventory to a financing entity, which uses this new collateral to secure a loan from a bank. The financing entity then remits the bank funds to the business, and the business repurchases the inventory and provides the financing entity with a fee. While the legal title of the business inventory was transferred to the financing entity,the inventory is still essentially owned by the business."
517,Finite Reinsurance,"Finite reinsurance is a category of reinsurance which cedesa finite or limited amount of risk to the reinsurer.By transferring less risk to the reinsurer, the insurer receives coverage on its potential claims at a lower cost than with traditional reinsurance.Risk reduction is from accounting or financial methods, along with the actual transfer of risk to another company. ",Finite reinsurance is reinsurance that a primary insurer or ceding company purchases from the reinsurer or the assuming insurer. Reinsurance is finite when it only covers specific risks and specific conditions. The reinsurer does not paythe primary insurer if the specified conditions are unmet.
518,Finite Risk Insurance,"Finite risk insurance is a transaction between an insurer and insured in which the insured pays a premium that constitutes a pool of funds for the insurer to use to pay losses. The insured does not actually transfer much or any risk of loss per occurrence to the insurer. If losses are lower than the premium, the insurer returns most or all of the premium to the insured. If the losses exceed the premium, the insured pays additional premium to the insurer.","Standard insurance arrangements, as opposed to finite risk insurance, have the insured transferring a liability associated with a specific risk to an insurer, and for this service the insurer earns a premium or fee. The insurer maintains a loss reserve with its own funds and is able to keep any income that it makes. Finite risk insurance is an alternative risk transfer type of insurance product, with features of both excess insurance and self-insurance. It allows the insured to spread out payments for losses over time, while retaining the ability to receive a refund of some of its premiums and investment income if losses are less than anticipated."
519,Fire Insurance,"Fire insurance is property insurance covering damage and losses caused by fire. The purchase of fire insurance in addition to homeowners or property insurance helps tocoverthe cost of replacement, repair, or reconstruction of property, above the limit set by the property insurance policy.Fire insurance policies typically contain general exclusions, such as war, nuclear risks, and similar perils.","Fire insurance policies includepayment for loss of use, or additional living expenses due to uninhabitable conditions as well as damage to personal propertyand nearby structures.Homeowners should document the property and its contents to simplify the assessment of items damaged or lost during a fire."
520,First-Loss Policy,"A first-loss policy is a type of property insurance policy that provides only partial insurance. In the event of a claim, the policyholder agrees to accept an amount less than the full value of damaged, destroyed or stolen items orproperty. In return, the insurer agrees to not penalize the policyholder for under-insuring their goods or property.","First-loss policies are most commonly used astheft or burglary insurance to insure against events where a total loss is extremely rare (i.e. the burglary of all goods contained in a large store). In a first-loss policy claim event, the policyholder does not seek compensation for losses below the first-loss level. Premiums are calculated proportionately,meaning they are not based on the full value of total goods or property."
521,Flex Dollars,"Schools oremployerswill issue flex dollarsfor purchasing such items as meal plans, health costs, and other expenses. Flex dollars are usually eitheranelectronic currencyor a portion of an employee's wage structure.Flex moneyaccounts typically work on a declining balance system similar to a debit card. An individual using the flex dollar accountdecideshow to spend funds,which reduce the accountbalance. ",There are two general uses for flex dollars. The firstand most familiaruseis in a university or other educational setting. The second use is employerissued funds for the elective use by an employee.
522,Floater Insurance,Floater insurance is a type of insurance policy that covers property that is easily movable and provides additional coverage over what normal insurance policies do not. This can cover anything from jewelry to expensive stereo equipment.,"Often, homeowners insurance will not fully cover some items. Adding a floaterpolicy assures the homeowner that the full value will be replaced in the event of theft, loss or damage. Thesepolicies generally cover one individual item, so if you have several items for which you want full coverage, you will need to get a floaterfor each."
523,Flood Insurance,"Flood insurance is a type of property insurance that coversa dwelling for losses sustained by water damage, as it specifically relates to flooding. A separate coverage rider is needed to cover sewer backup, if the backup was not caused by the rising floodwaters.","A flood insurance policy is different than a basic hazard insuranceor homeowners insurance policy, as it only covers losses that occur due to flooding. Standard homeowners insurance policies will cover most other losses as long as they are not related to flooding. These claimable events include losses sustained by fire, wind damage and falling trees, to name a few. Unlike a standard hazard policy, flood insurance requires a policyholder buy separate policies to cover a dwelling and its contents."
524,Flotation,"Flotation is the process of converting a private company into a public company by issuing shares available for the public. It allows companies to obtain financing externally instead of using retained earnings to fund new projects or expansion. The term ""flotation"" is commonly used in the United Kingdom, whereas the term ""going public"" is more widely used in the United States.","Flotation requires careful considerations regarding timing, company structure, the company's ability to withstand public scrutiny, increased regulatory compliance costs, and the time involved in effecting the flotation and attracting investors. While flotation provides access to new sources of capital, flotation costs, the expenses associated with issuing new stock, must be accounted for when considering the switch from a private to public company."
525,Follow On Public Offer (FPO),A follow-on public offer (FPO) is the issuance of shares to investors by a public company that is currently listed on a stock market exchange. An FPO is a stock issue of additional shares made by a company that is already publicly listed and has gone through the IPO process. FPOs are popular methods for companies to raise additional equity capital in capital markets through an issue of stock.,
526,Follow The Settlements,Follow the settlements is a clause in a reinsurance contract that indicates how a ceding insurance company will allocate a settlement to its reinsurers. A ceding company is an insurance company that passes the part or all of its risks from its insurance policy portfolio to a reinsurance firm.,"The allocation outlined in a follow-the-settlement clause is dependent on whether the reinsurance agreement is facultative reinsurance or treaty reinsurance. A follow-the-settlements clause is a narrower version of a follow-the-fortunes clause, although the two phrases are often used interchangeably."
527,Follow-On Offering,"A follow-on offering (FPO) is an issuance of stock shares following a company's initial public offering (IPO). There are two types of follow-on offerings, diluted and non-diluted. A diluted follow-on offering results in the company issuing new shares, which causesthe lowering of a company's earnings per share (EPS). During a non-diluted follow-on offering, shares coming into the market already existing andthe EPS remains unchanged. Companies offering additional shares must register the FPO offering and provide a prospectus to regulators.","An initial public offeringIPObases its price on the health and performance of the company and the price the company hopes to achieve per share during the initial offering. The pricing of a follow-on offering is market-driven. Since the stock is already publicly traded, investors have a chance to value the company before buying.The price of follow-on shares is usually at a discount to the current, closing market price. Also, FPO buyers need to understand that investment banks directly working on the offering will tend to focus on marketing efforts rather than purely on valuation."
528,Following Reinsurer,"A following reinsurer is areinsurance company that jointly signs onto a reinsurance treaty with other reinsurance companies, but it is not the reinsurer that negotiated the terms of the agreement.","A following reinsurer is subject to the same terms as the reinsurer responsible for the negotiations –the lead reinsurer–and is often a company that has a more narrow expertise than the lead reinsurer.The market for reinsurance is often dominated by a small number of companies with the buying power and expertise required to provide coverage against a broad range of perils. These reinsurers are the most likely to take the lead on negotiating the terms, conditions, and price of a reinsurance contract, hence they are called the lead reinsurers. All other reinsurers involved in the reinsurance contract are referred to as following reinsurers."
529,Forced Initial Public Offering,A forced initial public offering is an instance in which a company is forced to issue shares to the public for the first time.Forced IPOs occur when a company goes public due to certain conditions being met which are set by the securities regulatory body of the country. Initial public offerings are usually conducted at the discretion of the current management and/or owners of the private company.,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets the standards for when companies must accept a forced initial public offering. That standard isif the company has a certain amount of assets (around 10 million) and ifthere are more than 500 shareholders of record. If those conditions are met,the company muststart disclosing specific financial information publicly and in a timely manner. Some companies might not want to go public because it means increased oversight and reporting standards, which usually means increased costs. The reason for the law is to increase transparency and reduce risks for investors."
530,Forced Place Insurance,"Lien holders will put forced place insurance onto a mortgaged property in cases where the borrower allows the coverage they were required to purchaseto lapse. Lapses may be due to non-payment of premium, filing false claims, or other reasons. Forced place insurance will protect the property, the homeowner,and the lien holder. Future mortgage payments will reflect the added cost of the insurance","Forced place insurance is also known as creditor-placed, lender-placed, or collateral protection insurance."
531,Foreign Credit Insurance Association - FCIA,The Foreign Credit Insurance Association (FCIA) is an association of insurance companies that offersinsurance toU.S. exporters against nonpayment by foreign customers due to commercial and political risks,"The Foreign Credit Insurance Association offers insurance to reduce the risks export companies take when they engage in trade with foreign countries. Since exporters typically do not receive advance payment for orders they ship, they run the risk that buyers willdefaulton payments. Typical reasons for default include commercial issues such as issues with a buyer's cash flow, bankruptcy or other market-based issues. International markets also present political risks such as war, political revolutions or difficulty in converting a foreign currency. Further complicating matters, the presence of buyers in foreign countries puts them beyond the reach of the typical laws a seller could use to recover its losses in a domestic market."
532,Form 4684: Casualties And Thefts,"Form 4684: Casualties And Thefts is aU.S. Internal Revenue ServiceForm for reporting gains or losses from casualties and thefts which may be deductible for taxpayers who itemize deductions. Taxpayers who live in federally declared disasterareas do not need to itemize deductions to file Form 4684.Casualty losses can be the result of fires, floods, and other disasters. In most cases, taxpayers can deduct losses in the tax year in which they happened. In the case of theft, the tax year is the year ofloss discovery.","Taxpayers cannot use Form 4684 to deduct expenses related to personal injuries. Also, in most cases, this form only applies to personal losses, not for casualties and thefts related to the business property. "
533,Franchise Cover,Franchise cover is a type of reinsurance plan in which the claims from a number of policies are aggregated together to form a reinsurance claim. Franchise covers are also known as loss trigger covers. Other types of non-proportional reinsurance with aggregate covers are aggregate stop loss reinsurance and catastrophe covers.,"One type of threshold used in reinsurance contracts is the franchise cover, which is used to limit the amount of reinsurance that is provided to a ceding insurer.Insurance contracts often require the insured to retain losses up to a certain threshold, with the insurer only covering losses that exceed this threshold. The amount of losses that the insurer will ultimately pay for is set by the policys coverage limit. Reinsurance contracts can have similar features, meaning that the reinsurer is not responsible for losses until a certain threshold is met."
534,Free Look Period,"A free look period is a period of time in which a new life insurance policy owner can terminate the policywithout penalties, such as surrender charges. A free look period often lasts10 or more days (depending on the insurer), allowing the contract holderto decide whether or not to keep it; if he or she is not satisfied and wishes to cancel, the policypurchaser can receive a full refund. Free look periods are most commonly associated with life insurance policies. In fact, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring them for various types of life insurance policies.","During the free look period, the purchaser can continue to ask the insurer questions regarding the contract in order to better understand the policy. If refunded, the amount given back may equate to the value of the account at cancellation orthe amount of payments, dependingon the state in which the policy was written."
535,Free of Particular Average (FPA),Free of Particular Average (FPA) is an insurance contract clause that eliminates an insurers liability for partial losses. FPA clauses are most commonly found in marine insurance policies.,"In shipping parlance, the wordaverage is associated with losses, andgeneral average refers to a loss associated with cargo or the ship itself. The expense of protecting the ship and its cargo is typically shared between the shipowner, the cargo owner, and other interested parties on a pro-rata basis. Because the interests of the different parties do not always overlap (e.g., the shipowner may care less about the cargo than the cargo owner), maritime transportation expenses are shared so that all parties have an incentive to cooperate. The parties will purchase a marine cargo policy, also known as a voyage policy, to protect themselves from certain perils."
536,Freed Up,"In the initial public offering world, freed uprefers to the time after the lock-up period when investment bank underwriters are no longer obligated to sell securities at the agreed upon price. When an investment bank is freed up, it is allowed to trade any remaining securities at the prevalent market price.",Freed up also applies to the companyinsiderswho hold shares of the business. These holders of private company shares may have contractual restrictions on selling their shares on the open market until after the lock-up period.
537,Freeriding,Freeriding is an illegal practice in which an underwriting syndicate member withholds part of a new securities issue and later sells it at a higher price. Freeriding also refers to the illegal activity of anyone buying a stock and selling it before paying for the purchase.,"Due to the unfair advantage both of these types of freeriding practices give to those able to exploit suchopportunities, freeriding is illegal and prohibited by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and the National Association of Securities Dealers."
538,Frequency-Severity Method,Frequency-severity method is an actuarial method for determining the expected number of claims that an insurer will receive during a given time periodand how much the average claim will cost. Frequency-severity method uses historical data to estimate the average number of claims and the average cost of each claim. The method multiplies the average number of claims by the average cost of a claim.,"In the frequency-severity method, frequency refers to the number of claims that an insurer anticipates will occur over a given period of time. If the frequency is high, it means that a large number of claims is expected to occur. Severity refers to the cost of a claim. A high-severity claim is more expensive than an average claim, and a low-severity claim is less expensive than the average claim. Average costs of claims are estimated based on historical data."
539,Fronting Policy,"Fronting policy is arisk management technique in which an insurer underwrites a policy to cover a specific risk, but then cedes the risk to a reinsurer. Fronting policies are most commonly used by large organizations, and is a type of alternative risk transfer (ART). Because the reinsurer takes on the entire policy risk, it has complete control of the claims process.","The insurance company that underwrites the original policy is called the fronting company. The fronting company receives a percentage of the premium despite ceding all of the risks to the reinsurer. By issuing the insurance policy, the fronting company appears to be the insurer, though in reality it transfers all risk to the reinsurer."
540,Full Reporting Clause,"A full reporting clause, also known as an honesty clause, is a provision to an insurance policy requiring the policyholder to provide the insurer with the value of insured items. Property insurance policies contain full reporting clauses.","Determining the cost of articles covered by an insurance policy is an essential part of insurance contracts. While it is a time-consuming step, it allows individuals and businesses to estimate the total amount of coverage they need. Understanding how much an item is worth lets insurers determine replacement costs when losses occur."
541,Fully Subscribed,Fully subscribed is the position an initial bond or stock offering finds itself in once all shares of an offering have been purchased or guaranteed by investors. An underwriting company usually facilitates these initial transactions on behalf of younger companies that are making their initial public offerings.,"A fully subscribed offering is the goal of an initial offering. It prevents a company from having shares left over that they cannot sell after they go public, or shares that must undergo a price reduction to be purchased by investors."
542,Funding Cover,"Funding cover refers to insurance premiums held in an account in conjunction with an excess-of-loss reinsurance, which is used to pay insurance claims. Funding covers act as a resource pool that can be drawn down to pay for claims, with unused funds returned to either policyholders or ceding insurers.","Funding covercan be used to generate investment income.When an insurance company underwrites a new policy it is agreeing to indemnify the policyholder from covered losses. In exchange for taking on this risk the insurer is paid a premium. The premium is used to pay claims, as well as generate investment income. Insurers have to balance the mechanisms they use to manage funding for future claims with their desire to generate profits by investing premiums."
543,Fureai Kippu,"Fureai kippuisa complementary currency system for providing elder care in Japan. The system of fureai kippu, or ""caring relationship tickets,"" allows individuals to earn credits by caring for a local elderly or handicapped person. They can redeem those credits toward care for a non-local elderly person, such as a parent who lives far away or themselves if they get sick. The tickets can also be saved and redeemed in the future.","Tsutoma Hotta, former Attorney General and Minister of Justice in Japan, coined the termfureai kippu and created this system in the mid-1990s."
544,Furriers Block Policy,"A furriers block policy is a specialty insurance policy historically intended to cover the inventory of a fur dealer against transportation risk. Specifically, this policy was intended to protect the dealer against inventory loss during transit along inland waterways.","Furriers block policies became a specialized form of insurance in the 19th century. Like precious gems and jewels, furs were extremely delicate and valuable items that involved lengthy and risky travel from source to market. Fire, smoke, water damage and theft were historically among the chief threats to inventory along the supply chain. Traditional commercial insurance was generally too expensive to cover such valuables. In more recent years, protest and vandalism have emerged as risks to furriers inventories."
545,Furriers Customers Policy,A furriers customers policy is an inland marine insurance policy that provides coverage against loss or damage to furs that are being stored by a business on behalf of a third party. Furriers customers policies provide coverage beyond the ordinary care that a storage company is expected to provide with respect to the property of its customers.,"Furriers customers policies are designed specifically for businesses that store furs and garments trimmed with fur owned by third parties. The total amount of coverage required, depends on the number of furs held in storage and the value of the furs according to the bailor."
546,Future Purchase Option,"A future purchase option is afeature of long-term disability insurance that allows policyholders to increase their insurance coverage annually as their income increases, without medical underwriting, in exchange for paying a higher premium.","The future purchase option is typically valid until the policyholder reaches a specified age. The future purchase option means that even if a policyholder develops a health condition that would make it expensive or impossible to qualify for a new policy, they can purchase additional coverage under their existing policy because the future purchase option does not require the policyholder to pass a medical exam."
547,Gap Insurance,Gap insurance is a type of auto insurance that car owners can buy to protect themselves against losses that can arise when the amount of compensation received from a total loss does not fully cover the amount the insured owes on the vehicle's financing or lease agreement. This situation arises when the balance owed on a car loan is greater than the book value of the vehicle.,"As an example of gap insurance at work, considerJohn's car, which isworth $15,000. However, he still owes a total of $20,000 worth of car payments. In the event that John's car is completely written off as a result of an accident or theft, John's car insurance policy will reimburse him with $15,000. Because John owes the car financing company $20,000, however, he will still be $5,000 short, even though he no longer has a car."
548,Garage Liability Insurance,"Garage liability insurance is specialty insurance targeted to the automotive industry. Automobile dealerships, parking lots or parking garages operators,tow-truck operators, service stations, andcustomization and repair shops will add garage liability insurance to their business liability coverage. The policy protects property damageand bodily injury resulting from operations.",This insurance is not the same thing as garage-keepers coverage.
549,Gatekeeper,"A gatekeeper refers to requirements that must be met before an individual can qualify for a long-term care plan or to an individual who oversees a patient treatment through a health maintenance organization, or HMO.","Because there are two different definitions for what a gatekeeper is, they can be analyzed separately."
550,General Account,"The general account is where an insurer deposits premiums from policies it underwritesand from which it funds day-to-day operations of the business.The general account does not dedicate collateral to a specific policy, and instead treats all funds in aggregate.","When an insurance company underwrites a new policy, it is paid a premium by the policyholder. These premiums are deposited into the insurers general account. The insurer will use these funds in a variety of ways. It will set aside a portion as a loss reserve, which is used to cover the estimated losses it expects may occur over the course of the year. It will also use these funds to pay for operations, personneland other business expenses. In order to increase profitability, however, it will also invest some of these premiums in assets of various risk profiles and liquidities."
551,General Employer,"A general employer is an employer who loans an employee to another business, and who is the employees original employer. Such arrangements are usually conducted on a temporary basis. A general employer is not held responsible for the actions of the employee; instead, the business that borrows the employee is responsible despite not being the permanent employer.","General employer is the term that describes a business that lets another business borrow one or more of its employees for a specified period time. This arrangement is regulated under theborrowed servant rule. The borrowed servant rule shifts liability from the workers regular employer to the employer that is temporarily borrowing the workers. The temporary employer is called the special employer, since the arrangement is typically temporary."
552,Genetic Engineering,"Genetic engineering is the artificial modification of an organisms genetic composition. Genetic engineering typically involves transferring genes from one organism into another organism of a different species to give the latter specific traits of the former. The resulting organism is called a transgenic or genetically modified organism, or GMO. Examples of such organisms include plants that are resistant to certain insects and plants that can withstand herbicides.","Genetic engineering is also being used on farm animals, with research objectives such as ensuring chickens cannot spread avian flu to other birds, or that cattle cannot develop the infectious prions that causemad cow disease."
553,Genomics,"Genomics refers to the study of the entire genetic code of any particular species. In humans, this code contains about 3billion pairs of chemicals that make up DNA and the entire code is replicated within each cell in the body. The study of genomics achieved prominence in the late 1990s as scientists raced to create a comprehensive map of the entire human genome.",
554,Good Student Discount,"Good Student Discount is an auto insurance policy discount available to young drivers who earn good grades in school. The good student discount assumes that if a young driver is responsible when it comes to their studies, they are more likely to be a responsible driver. As a result, they (or their parents) deserve to pay lower insurance premiums since they are less likely than teens with poor grades to file a claim with the insurance company. Since teenage drivers face some of the highest insurance premiums due to their lack of driving experience and higher accident and traffic violation risk, a good student discount provides yet another incentive to do well in school: saving money.","Insurance companies are free to decide whether to offer a good student discount and, if so, to set their own guidelines for those discounts. For example, one insurer might offer a 25% discount on premiums to full-time high school and college students who earn good grades, defined as a B average or higher, until age 25. Another insurer might offer a 15% good student discount to unmarried drivers with at least a 3.0 grade point average in high school or college."
555,Graham-Cassidy Healthcare Bill,"The Graham-Cassidy bill is a Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA or ""Obamacare"") that would transfer much of the responsibility for structuring, funding and regulatingof healthcare markets to the states. It was proposed by Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in September 2017, following a number of failed attempts to roll back Obamacare from March to July. Although they planned to vote on the bill during the week of September 25, following an incomplete Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score, the vote did not happen. The decision not to vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill marked the fourth Obamacare repeal bill failure in 2017,",The bill's full name is the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill;Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) are co-sponsors.
556,Grandfathered Health Plan,"A grandfathered health plan is a health insurance policy created or purchased on or before March 23, 2010. A grandfathered health plan is exempt from many consumer protections required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the U.S. health reform signed into law on March 23, 2010 by President Obama. Grandfathered status applies to group health plans and individual health insurance policies respectively crated or purchased before enactment of the ACA. With group plans (through an employer), grandfathered status depends on the date of plan creation, not the date an employee joins the plan.",
557,Greenshoe Option,"In security issues, a greenshoe option is an over-allotment option. In the context of an initial public offering (IPO), it is a provision in an underwriting agreement that grants the underwriter the right to sell investors more shares than originally planned by the issuer if the demand for a security issue proves higher than expected.","Over-allotment options are known as greenshoe options becausein 1919, Green Shoe Manufacturing Company (now part of Wolverine Worldwide Inc.)was the first to issue this type of option. A greenshoe option can provide additional price stability to a security issue because the underwriter has the ability to increase supply and smooth out price fluctuations. It is the only type of price stabilization measure permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."
558,Gross Leverage Ratio,"Gross leverage ratio is the sum of an insurance companys net premiums written ratio, net liability ratio and ceded reinsurance ratio. Gross leverage ratio is used to determine how exposed an insurer is to pricing and estimation errors, as well as its exposure to reinsurance companies.","The ideal gross leverage ratiodepends on what type of insurance a company is underwriting, though the desired range typically falls below 5.0 for property insurers and7.0 for liability insurers. An insurers gross leverage will typically be higher than its net leverage because the gross leverage ratio includes ceded reinsurance leverage. Other types of leverage ratios used in the insurance industry include net leverage, reinsurance recoverables to policyholders surplus, and Bests Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR)."
559,Gross Line,Gross line is the maximum amount of coverage an insurer is willing to underwrite for a particular risk. The gross line is calculated before anydeductions and represents the insurers totallimit of liability.,"Gross line sets the total amount of liability an insurer is willing to take on in exchange for the premiums being paid to cover that risk. An insurer will often reduce their gross risk by using reinsurers. This allows them to move some of the liability off of their books, which in turn opens up their capacity to underwrite additional policies."
560,Gross National Happiness - GNH,"Gross national happiness is a measure of economic and moral progress that the King of Bhutan introduced in the 1970s as an alternative to gross domestic product. Rather than focusing strictly on quantitative economic measures, gross national happiness takes into account an evolving mix of quality-of-life factors.","Gross national happiness (GNH) is a term with roots in the Himalayan country of Bhutan. The kingdoms first legal code, written at the time of unification in 1729, stated thatif the Government cannot create happiness for its people, there is no purpose for the government."" King Jigme Singye Wangchuck told the Financial Times in a 1972 interview thatgross national happiness is more important than gross national product. It is not clear how seriously King Jigme had thought through this new metric, but Bhutanese scholars have since picked up the idea and run with it. The GNH has evolved into a somewhat scientific measure of the once-isolated kingdom's economic and moral development."
561,Gross Net Written Premium Income,"Gross net written premium income (GNWPI)isthe amount of an insurance companys premiums that are used to determine what portion of premiumsis owed to a reinsurer. Gross net written premium income is the base, which thereinsurance premium rate is applied to, takinginto account cancelations, refunds, and premiums paid for reinsurance coverage.","Gross net written premium income isthe amount of an insurance companys premiums utilizedto determine the portion of premums due to the reinsurer.When an insurance company enters into a reinsurance agreement, it reduces its overall risk exposure by ceding some risks to a reinsurer. In exchange for taking on these risks, the reinsurer is entitled to a portion of the insurers premiums. In a non-proportional reinsurance agreement, the amount of premiums that the reinsurer is entitled to is determined by a fixed rate. This rate is multiplied by a base premium, which represents the amount of an insurers premiums that the reinsurer is entitled to."
562,Gross Profits Insurance,"Gross profits insurance is a type of business interruption insurance that provides funds in the amount of profit lost if an insurable event, such as property damage, occurs. Gross profits insurance is most commonly used in the United Kingdom and Canada. This type of insurance differs from gross earnings insurance, which is more commonly found in the United States.","Gross profit insurance is designed tobring back the insured to where it would have been financially assuming the insurable event had not occurred. The amount of loss that a business experiences is calculated based on a pre-defined formula, and typically relies on historical rates of turnover to determine the amount a business is losing. Gross profit is calculated as turnover less purchases and variable costs. The loss formula looks at turnover over a specific period of time, such as twelve months, though extenuating circumstances that have affected turnover during the examination period may need to be smoothed out."
563,Ground-Up Loss,"Ground-up loss is thetotal amount of loss that is covered by an insurance policy. Ground-up loss does not include deductibles paid by the insured, nor does it include reinsurance recoverables.","Insurance companies take a number of factors, including ground-up loss, into account when determining the total amount of coverage they are willing to extend to a policyholder when underwriting a new insurance policy. The insurers baseline consideration is based on the ground-up loss, which represents the total loss that the insurer will have to cover if the insured does not have to pay a deductible and if the insurer does not cede any liability to a reinsurance company."
564,Group Health Insurance Plan,A group health insurance plan is a health insurance plan that provides coverage to members of a group that tends to be employees of a company or members of an organization. Members of the group usually receive insurance at a reduced cost because the insurers risk is spread across a group of policyholders.,"Group health insurance in the United States has evolved during the 20th century. The idea of collective coverage first entered into public discussion during World War I and the Great Depression. Soldiers fighting in the First World War received coverage through the War Risk Insurance Act, which Congress later extended to cover servicemens dependents. In the 1920s, healthcare costs increased to the point that they exceeded most consumers ability to pay. The Great Depression exacerbated this problem dramatically, but resistance from the American Medical Association and the life insurance industry defeated several efforts to establish any form of a national health insurance system. This opposition would remain strong into the 21st century."
565,Group Life Insurance,"Group life insurance is offered by an employer or other large-scale entity, such an association or labor organization, to its workers or members. This life insurance, which typically is inexpensive or even free, and has relatively low coverage amount, is typically offered as a piece of a larger employer or membership benefit package.","By purchasing group life insurance policy coverage through an insurance provider on a wholesale basis for its members, companies are able to secure costs for each individual employee that are much lower than if they were to purchase an individual policy."
566,Group Term Life Insurance,"Group term life insurance is a type of term insurance whereby the insurer issues the employer a master contract with coverage extended to employees. Group term life insurance is relatively inexpensive compared to individual life insurance. As a result, participation is high. It is commonly a component of a comprehensive benefits package.",
567,Group Universal Life Policy (GULP),A group universallife policy isuniversal life insuranceoffered toa group that is less expensive than what is typically offered to an individual.A group universal life policy is most commonly purchased by businesses looking to provide life insurance coverage for their employees.,"Buying a group universal life policy is similar to buying food in bulk. The cost to cover each individual is cheaper because the policy is designed to cover a large group, just as purchasing a large amount of a particular grocery item is cheaper on a per item basis than buying each item separately."
568,Guaranteed Cost Premium,Guaranteed cost premium refers to cost premiums charged for an insurance policy that are not adjusted for loss experience. Guaranteed cost premium represents a flat fee that the insured pays for coverage over a policy period.,"Most policyholders are familiar with the guaranteed cost approach to determining the premiums that they pay for insurance. An individual or business purchases a policy to cover a specified peril for a specified period of time, and is charged a flat rate for the duration of the policy. While the insurance company does take into account the type of peril, the potential severity and frequency of claims, and the riskiness of the insured, the premium is not adjusted once it has been published."
569,Guaranteed Investment Contract - GIC,Insurance contracts that guarantee the owner principal repayment and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time. ,Guaranteed investment contracts are typically issued by insurance companies and marketed to institutions that qualify for favorable tax status under federal laws. These products provide institutions with guaranteed returns. 
570,Guaranteed Investment Fund (GIF),"Guaranteed investment income is a type of investment product offered by insurance companies that allows its client to invest in an equity, bond and/orindex fund while providing a promise ofapredefined minimum value of the fund (usually, the initial investment amount) will be available at the fund's maturity or when the client dies. Insurance companies usually charge up to 1 percentof the investment amount per year for this service.",Some guaranteed investment income funds also give people the opportunity to resetthe guaranteed amount during specific periods of time. This allows investors to lock in greater sums in the event that they incur a large capital gain.
571,Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance ,"Guaranteed issue life insurance, or guaranteed acceptance life insurance, is a life-insurance policy with no health qualifications.","Guaranteed issue life insurance, like all life insurance, pays cash to a named beneficiary upon the death of the insured. The key difference is that with guaranteed issue life insurance a company cannot deny an applicant coverage as long as that applicant can afford the premiums. Because guaranteed issue life insurance policies are available to people with no medical underwriting, they charge higher premiums for lower payouts than conventional policies. For that reason, guaranteed issue life insurance tends to attract applicants with health histories that preclude their enrolling in better policies and who cant purchase life insurance through their employers."
572,Guaranteed Issue Rights,"Guaranteed issuerights are rightsafforded to individuals insured under Medicare that requires insurance companies to offer Medicare supplement insurance, also called a Medigap policy. Guaranteed issue rights prevent insurers from denying a Medigap policy, from placing restrictions on the policy due to previous medical conditions, or from charging more because of previous conditions.","Guaranteed issue rights, also called Medigap protections, protect individuals who lose their health care coverage or if their health care coverage changes. These rights apply to those who have a form of Medicare insurance already, including Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage, or if the individual previously had Medigap insurance but later moved to a different form of Medicare. In order to qualify an individual must have both Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B, but the individual is not allowed to purchase the policy if he or she already has a Medicare Medical Savings Account."
573,Guaranteed Renewable Policy,"A guaranteed renewablepolicy is an insurance policy feature that obligates the insurer to continue coverage as long as premiums are paid on the policy. While re-insurability is guaranteed, premiums can rise based on the filing of a claim, injury, or other factors that could increase the risk of future claims.Premiums can also be raised on an entire class of insured people during the life of a guaranteed renewable policy for health, life or disability insurance.","Most insurers offer both guaranteed renewable policies and non-cancelable policies. If premiums are similar for both a guaranteed and a non-cancelable policy, the non-cancelable policy will offer the double guarantee of re-insurability and locked-in premiums."
574,Guideline Premium And Corridor Test (GPT),The Guideline Premium And Corridor Test (GPT) test is used to determine whether an insurance product can be taxed asinsurance rather than as an investment. GPTlimits the amount of premiums that can be paid into an insurance policy relative to the policys death benefit.,"Being able to pass the guided premium and corridor test is incredibly important to a policyholder as well as the insurer. If an insurance product fails to pass the test, it is no longer considered an insurance product, and is thus taxed like an investment. Insurance policies are able to grow in value on a tax-deferred basis, with death benefits being exempt from income tax. Most other investments are taxed as ordinary income, meaning that failing to pass the test will lead to a higher tax rate."
575,HIPAA Waiver of Authorization,A legal document that allows an individuals health information to be used or disclosed to a third party. The waiver is part of a series of patient-privacy measures set forth in the Health Insurance Portability and AccountabilityAct (HIPAA) of 1996.,"The HIPAA waiver of authorization allows doctors to provide information on a patients health to third parties, such as researchers, attorneys, other doctors or family members. It became necessary because healthcare privacy has come into increased focused in the digital age; it is much easier for doctors to transmit patient health information via the Internet than it was when records had to be mailed or faxed."
576,HSA Custodian,"Any bank, credit union, insurance company, brokerage or other IRS-approved organization that offers health savings accounts (HSAs). Financial institutions that manage HSAs are also called HSA administrators. An HSA custodian or administrator simply holds HSA assets; the account holder directs how to use them.","An HSA custodian makes it possible for individuals to contribute to an HSA and withdraw funds as needed to pay medical bills. Custodians pay interest on cash balances, and some let account holders invest in stocks, bonds and funds to potentially earn a higher rate of return on money they dont need to pay for medical expenses in the short term."
577,Hammer Clause,"A hammer clause is aninsurance policy clause that allows an insurer to compel the insured to settle a claim. A hammer clause is also known as a blackmail clause, settlement cap provisionor consent to settlement provision. This clause gets its name from the power given to the insurer to force the insured to settle, much as how a hammer is used against a nail.","Hammer clauses allow the insurer to force the insured to settle. It does this by placing a cap on the amount of indemnification that it is willing to provide. This cap may be set, for example, at the amount the insurer thinks that the settlement is worth. If the insured refuses to settle, it may be responsible for its own defense costs."
578,Hardship Exemption,"Hardship Exemption is an approved excuse from paying a penalty fee for not having health insurance. A hardship exemption can be granted if an individual is in a situation that affects his or her ability to purchase health coverage. Hardship exemptions are a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law on March 23, 2010. Starting in 2014, most individuals were required to have an acceptable health-coverage level known as minimum essential coverage, or pay a fee (called theindividual shared responsibility payment). In certain cases, people can qualify for exemptions, including hardship exemptions, whereby no penalty is assessed for having no insurance. As of 2019, the penalty for not having health insurance will be eliminated, so the exemptions below apply to the 2015-2018 tax years.",Ahardship exemption may be granted for these accepted circumstances:
579,Hazard Insurance,"Hazard insuranceprotects a property owner against damage caused by fires, severe storms, earthquakes or other natural events. As long as the specific event is covered within the policy, the property owner will receive compensation to cover the cost of any damage incurred. Typically, the property owner will be required to pay for a year's worth of premiums at the time of closing, but this will depend on the exact details of the policy.","Hazard insuranceprotects a property owner against damage caused by fires, severe storms, earthquakes or other natural events.A typical property orhomeowners' insurance policy usually won't cover all events that coulddamageyour property. In high-risk areas, some events will definitely be excluded from homeowners' insurance. For example, Florida is prone to hurricanes and is, therefore, considered high risk. If ahomeowner lives in a high-risk area, he or she may need a separate policy,such as a flood insurance policy, which is a type of hazard insurance."
580,Hazardous Activity,"A recreational pursuit that a life or disability insurance policy considers high risk. Hazardous activities include scuba diving, BASE jumping, hang gliding, racecar driving, flying a plane, horseback riding, bungee jumping, parasailing, off-roading and more. If one of your hobbies falls under an insurance companys definition of a hazardous activity, you may not be able to get life or disability insurance, or you may have to pay a higher premium because the insurer considers you high risk. Another possibility is that the insurer will issue a policy, but it will exclude the hazardous activities from coverage. This exclusion means that if you become disabled or die while, say, bungee jumping, the policy will not pay, but if you become disabled or die because of a car accident, the policy will pay.","If youre tempted to omit a hazardous hobby on your insurance application in order to secure approval, be aware that insurance companies might find out about your hobbies through other means during the underwriting process, such as through reviewing your medical records and noting injuries sustained from hazardous activities, and may deny your application. Worse, if they dont find out and issue your policy, they could later deny a claim if you die from a hazardous activity that you partake in regularly and didnt disclose on your application. If you want coverage and cant get approved because of your hobby or cant afford the higher premiums, you may need to find a new, nonhazardous activity to occupy your free time. However, occasional participation in a hazardous activity, such as going scuba diving for the first time on a vacation, will not classify you as a high-risk applicant."
581,Health Insurance,"Health insurance is a type of insurance coverage that pays for medical and surgical expenses incurred by the insured. Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury, or pay the care provider directly. It is often included in employer benefit packages as a means of enticing quality employees. The cost of health insurance premiums is deductible to the payer, and benefits received are tax-free.","Health insurance can be tricky to navigate. Managed care insurance plans require policyholders to receive care from a network of designated health care providers for the highest level of coverage. If patients seek care outside the network, they must pay a higher percentage of the cost. In some cases, the insurance company may even refuse payment outright for services obtained out of network. Many managed care plans require patients to choose a primary care physician who oversees the patient's care and makes recommendations about treatment. Insurance companies may also deny coverage for services that were obtained without preauthorization. In addition, insurers may refuse payment for name brand drugs if a generic version or comparable medication is available at a lower cost."
582,Health Insurance Marketplace,"The health insurance marketplace is a platform which offers insurance plans to individuals, families or small businesses. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 established the marketplace as a means to achievemaximum compliance with the mandate that all Americans carry some form of health insurance. Many states offer their own marketplaces, while the federal government manages an exchange open to residents of other states.",
583,Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),Health Insurance Portabiilty and Accountability ACT (HIPAA) is an act created by the U.S. Congress in 1996 that amends both theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). HIPAA was enacted in an effort to protect individuals covered byhealth insuranceand to set standards for the storage and privacy of personal medical data.,"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ensures that individual health-care plans are accessible, portable and renewable, and it sets the standards and the methods for how medical data is shared across the U.S. health system in order to prevent fraud. It preempts state law unless the state's regulations are more stringent."
584,Health Maintenance Organization - HMO,A health maintenance organization (HMO) is an organization that provides health coverage for a monthly or annual fee. A Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) is a group of medical insurance providers that limit coverage to medical aid provided from doctors that are under the contract of HMO. These contracts allow for premiums to be lower since the health providers have the advantage of having patients directed to them; but these contracts also add additional restrictions to HMO's members.,An individual that needs to secure his own health insurance plan may find a variety of health insurance providers with unique features. One type of insurance provider that is popular in the health insurance marketplace is the health maintenance organization (HMO) which includes a network of physicians under its coverage.
585,Health Plan Categories,"Health plan categories refer to the four types of health insurance plans that are differentiated based on the average percentage of health-care expenses that will be paid by the plan. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the U.S. health reform enacted March 23, 2010, health insurance plans are offered in four actuarial levels: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. The level defines the amount of expenses each type of plan covers.","The higher the actuarial value (i.e. Gold and Platinum), the more that healthplan categorywill pay, on average, toward health-care expenses.The lower the actuarial value (Bronze and Silver), the less that health plan categorywill pay."
586,Health Savings Account - HSA,"A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged account created for individuals who are covered under high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) to save for medical expenses that HDHPs do not cover. Contributions are made into the account by the individual or the individual's employer and are limited to a maximum amount each year. The contributions are invested over time and can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses, which include most medical care such as dental, vision and over-the-counter drugs.","A Health Savings Account is one of the ways an individual can cut costs if he or she is faced with high deductibles. A deductible is the portion of an insurance claim that the insured pays out-of-pocket. A high-deductible health insurance plan (HDHP) is an insurance plan that has a higher annual deductible than typical health plans, with a minimum and maximum deductible of $1,300 and $6,550, respectively, for individuals. For families, the numbers are minimum $2,600 and maximum $13,100 deductibles. When an individual has paid the portion of a claim s/hes responsible for, the insurance company will cover the other portion, as specified in the contract. For example, under the HDHP, an individual with a deductible of $1,500 who makes a medical claim for $3,500 will have to pay $1,500 from his personal coffers since the insurer is only responsible for the excess, that is $2,000. To supplement the funds that an insured has to pay out-of-pocket, a Health Savings Account (HSA) can be used."
587,Healthcare Power Of Attorney - HCPA,A healthcare power of attorney or HCPA is a legal form that allows an individual to empower another with decisions regarding his or her healthcare and medical treatment.,Healthcarepower of attorneybecomes active when a person is unable to make decisions or consciously communicate intentions regarding treatments.
588,Hidden Load,"A hidden load is an undisclosed fee or sales charge, which is often hidden in the fine print of a fund's prospectus or in an insurance contract. In some cases, investors and clients do not realize they are paying the hidden load, as explicit attention is never drawn to the issue.","A hidden load is a cost that a customer is typically never told about. For example, most investors are unaware of the 12b-1 fee that mutual funds often charge. With this hidden load, the investor will pay an small, annual charge to cover the fund's promotional and advertising expenses."
589,High Ratio Loan,"A high ratio loan of any type for which a relatively small down payment must be made. For mortgages, a high value loan usually covers more than 80% of the property's value. Most high ratio home loans require some form of insurance coverage in order to protect the lender.",High ratio home loans allow lower income and asset buyers to purchase homes with relatively little cash on hand. The wisdom of this business practice was called into question during the mortgage crisis of 2008. High ratio loans generally charge higher rates than lower ratio loans.
590,High-Deductible Health Plan - HDHP,"A high-deductible health plan, or HDHP, is ahealth insurance plan with a high minimum deductible for medical expenses that the insurance holder must paybefore insurance coverage kicks in. A high-deductible health plan usually has a higher annual deductible than a typical health plan. The minimum deductible for a plan to fall into the category of an HDHP varies each year. For 2017, it was $1,300 for individuals and $2,600 for families. In 2018, it rose to $1,350 for individuals and $2,700 for families.",High-deductible health plans are thought to lower overall healthcare costs by forcing individuals to be more conscious of medical expenses.
591,Hole-In-One Insurance,Hole-in-one insurance is a type of price-indemnification coverage. Its named for insurance taken out by golf-tournament sponsors that run contests offering big-ticket prizes to one or more contestants who make a hole in one on a single try.,"This type of insurance is not limited to golf, however. Hole-in-one insurance also applies to sports leagues and retailers that offer similar contests with grand prizes such as Hawaiian vacations, new cars, cash or free merchandise."
592,Home Warranty,A home warranty is a residential service contract that covers the cost of maintaining household systems or appliances for a set period. A home warranty is different from ahome insurance contract.,"When purchasing a home, the buyer may not know how well the previous owners maintained and managed the components of the home. Information on the age of household appliances or their useful life in years may not be available at the time of purchase. Also, the search for an expert handyman or service provider may be time-consuming for the homeowner. Limited time and the high costs of paying for damages or replacements on multiple components of the home are the two main reasons that home buyers purchase home warranties."
593,Homeowners Insurance,Homeowners insurance is a form of property insurance that covers losses and damages to an individual's house and to assets in the home. Homeowners insurance also provides liability coverage against accidents in the home or on the property.,"When a mortgage is requested on a home, the homeowner is required to provide proof of insurance on the propertybefore the lending bank can issue him or her a mortgage. The property insurance can be acquired separately or by the lending bank. Homeowners who prefer to get their own insurance policy can compare multiple offers and pick the plan that works best for their needs. If the homeowner does not have their property covered from loss or damages, the bank may obtain one for them at an extra cost. Payments made towarda homeowners insurance policy are usually included in the monthly payments of the homeowners mortgage. The lending bank that receives the paymentallocates the portion for insurance coverage to an escrow account. Once the insurance bill comes due, the amount owed is settled from this escrow account."
594,Homeowners Protection Act,The Homeowners Protection Act is alaw designed to reduce the unnecessary payment of private mortgage insurance (PMI) by homeowners who are no longer required to pay it. The Homeowners Protection Act mandates that lenders disclose certain information about PMI. The law also stipulates that PMI must be automatically terminated for homeowners who accumulate the required amount of equity in their homes.,"The Homeowners Protection Act covers private residential mortgages purchased after July 29, 1999. It does not apply to Veterans Affairs (VA) or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans and posts a new set of requirements for ""high risk"" mortgages. This law also institutes new requirements for loans obtained before July 29, 1999."
595,Homestead Exemption,"A homestead exemptionprotects the value of a home from property taxes and creditors following the death of a homeowner spouse. A homestead exemption can be found in state statutes and constitutional provisions across the U.S. and is an automatic benefit in some states. In states where the homestead protection is not automatic, homeowners must file a claim which must be re-filed when moving primary residences.","The primary features of homestead exemptions aremeant to provide both physical and financial shelter for the surviving spouse, with regard totheir primary residence. Most homestead exemptions use a monetary value to determine property tax protection, implementing a progressive-style tax to home value in order to assure that homes with lower assessed value benefit the most from the exemption."
596,Honorable Undertaking,An honorable undertaking is a treaty clause commonly associated with reinsurance contracts encouraging an open dialogue between two parties in a disputed contract.,An honorable undertaking clause provides that arbitrators interpret a disputed reinsurance contract as an honorable exchange and not solely as a strict legal document. Reinsurance contracts typically contain many rules pertaining to how each party agrees to meet its requirements. When disagreements arise it is up to the courts to interpret what the intentions of each party were at the contracts inception. The inclusion of an honorable undertaking clause in the original contract can help narrow the focus of anysubsequent legal disagreements.
597,Hospital Insurance Trust Fund,"The hospital insurance (HI) trust fund is also known as part A of Medicare, the United States' health insurance program for people age 65 and older and certain disabled persons. It is financed through payroll taxes derived from current workers and employers as well as taxes on Social Security benefits. This trust fund is overseen by a board of trustees that report yearly to congress regarding its financial status. It has been projected to become insolvent a number of times throughout the years, due to legislative changes, and is currently projected to become insolvent in the year 2029.","The hospital insurance (HI) trust fund is a fund managed by the federal government that pays for health care services for Medicare recipients, including stays in hospitals, hospices and skilled nursing facilities (SNF). Medicare is a government-funded health insurance program for those 65 and older, disabled people and people with a specific set of health conditions specified by the government. The other parts of Medicare, parts B, C and D, pay for other types of health care services, and are funded through supplemental medical insurance (SMI) products beneficiaries pay for and through private insurance beneficiaries pay for."
598,Hourly Clause,"An hourly clause, also known as an hours clause, is a provision in a reinsurance contract requiring the time at which a loss occurs to be reported, and sometimes restricting coverage to a certain time frame. Hourly clauses are most commonly found in catastrophe reinsurance property policies.","An hourly clause is one of the specific contract terms reinsurers use to limit coverage and reduce their exposure to losses (it is not usually a separate clause in a reinsurance contract, but included as part of the Occurrence definition). In a reinsurance contract, the reinsurer agrees to indemnify the insurer up to a loss limit in exchange for a portion of the premium that the insurer collects through its underwriting activities. Reinsurers examine the potential frequency and severity of claims and the likelihood that a loss will occur, and build that into pricing and risk models. In the case of catastrophe reinsurance, the intermittence and unpredictability of natural catastrophes can make modeling difficult, and in response to this reinsurers often include terms that limit the scope of coverage."
599,Human-Life Approach,"The human-life approach is a method of calculating the amount of life insurance a family will need that is based on the financial loss the family would incur if the insured person were to pass away today. It is usually calculated by taking into account a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the insured individual's age, gender, planned retirement age, occupation, annual wage, employment benefits, as well as the personal and financial information of the spouse and/or dependent children.","Since the value of a human life has economic value only in its relation to other lives, such as a spouse or dependent children, this method is typically only used for families with working family members. The human-life approach contrasts the needs approach."
600,Hurricane Deductible,"A hurricane deductible is theamount a homeowner must pay before insurance will cover the damage caused by a hurricane. Hurricane deductibles are separate from regular homeowners insurance deductibles and are based on a percentage of the homes value. While a regular homeowners insurance policy deductible is a fixed dollar amount, like $500 or $2,000, a hurricane deductible might be 1to 5 percentof a homes value, or $1,000 to $5,000 for every $100,000 in home value.","Hurricane deductibles came about in 1992 after Hurricane Andrews massive damage to South Florida inflicted major losses on homeowners insurance companies. Insurance companies turn to reinsurers when theyre having trouble paying large amounts of claims all at once, but even reinsurance companies were struggling under such enormous losses. As a result, insurance companies began requiring hurricane deductibles in 19 states and Washington, D.C. Homes in these states, which are all on the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Coasts, are susceptible to hurricane damage."
601,IPO Lock-Up,"An IPO lock-up also referred to as a ""lock-up period,"" is a contractual caveat referring to a period after a company has gone public when major shareholders are prohibited from selling their shares. Lock-up periodsusually last between 90 to 180 days.Once the lock-up period ends, most trading restrictions are removed.","The purpose of an IPO lock-up is to prevent the flooding of the market with too much of a company's stock supply too quickly. Typically, only 20% of a company's outstanding shares are initially offered to the investing public. A single large shareholder trying to unload all of his holdings in the first week of trading could send the stock downward to the detriment of all shareholders. Empirical evidence suggests that after the end of the lock-up period, stock prices experience a permanent drop of about 1 to3 percent."
602,Impaired Insurer,"An impairedinsureris an insurance company that is potentially unable to fulfill its policy obligations, and has been placed under rehabilitation or conservation. An impaired insurer is not insolvent, but does pose a potential threat to its policyholders. States consider impaired insurers a risk because they may be unable to fulfill obligations afforded to its citizens in the case of an emergency.","State insurance commissions may determine that an insurance company may be an impaired insurer ifis running into trouble and may be unable to fulfill its obligations. A court can place the insurer in conservation or rehabilitation until the health of the company improves enough that the risk of insolvency has ended. An impaired insurer that is unable to exit court ordered conservation or rehabilitation may be considered an insolvent insurer, and may be forced into liquidation."
603,Implied Authority,"Implied authority refers to an agent with the jurisdiction to perform acts which are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of an organization. Under contract law, implied authority figures have the ability to make a legally binding contract on behalf of another person or company.","Implied authority is authority that is not express or written into acontract, but it is authority anagent is assumed to have in order to transact the businessfor aprincipal. Implied authority is incidental to express authority since not every single detail of an agent's authority can be spelled out in the written contract."
604,Impound,"Impound is an account maintained by mortgage companies to collect amounts such as hazard insurance, property taxes, private mortgage insurance and other required payments from the mortgage holders. These payments are necessary to keep the home but are not technically part of the mortgage.","Impound accounts are often required of borrowers who put down less than 20 percent. The purpose of the impound account is to protect the lender. Because low down-payment borrowers are considered high risk, the impound account assures the lender that the borrower will not lose the home because of liens or loss, as the lender pays insurance, taxes, etc., from the impound account when they are due. However, buyers don't need to maintain impound accounts forever. Once sufficientequity(usually20 percent)is achieved, lenders can often be convinced to closethe impound account."
605,Inchmaree Clause,"An Inchmaree clause isfound in maritime insurance policies andprovides coverage for the ships hull from loss or damage caused by machinery. The Inchmaree clause, also called the negligence clause, covers damage that is caused by negligence of ship personnel, such as engineers and captains, when navigating. It is a type of additional perils clause.","The Inchmareeclause was, in large part, developed with the advent of steam navigation and machinery aboard vessels.Shipping cargo across vast oceans can carry great risk. In addition to storms potentially sinking or flooding a ship, the actions of the ships crew and other personnel responsible for maintaining a properly working vessel may result in damage to the ships cargo. For example, a boiler that is not properly maintained may burst, causing a ship to lose power and run aground, or a shaft may break loose and strike items held in the cargo bay."
606,Incontestability Clause,An incontestability clause is a clause in most life insurance policies that prevents the provider from voiding coverage due to a misstatement by the insured after a specific amount of time has passed. A typical incontestability clause specifies that a contract will not be voidable after two or three years due to a misstatement.,"Incontestability clauses help protect insured people from firms who may try to avoid paying benefits in the event of a claim. While this provision benefits the insured,it cannotprotect against outright fraud. Lying to an insurance company with an intention to deceive can result in the cancellation of coverage or even criminal charges."
607,Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR),"Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) is a type of reserve account used in the insurance industry as the provisionfor claims and/or events that have transpired, but have not yet been reported to an insurance company. In IBNRsituations, an actuary will estimatepotential damages, and theinsurance company may decide to set up reserves to allocate funds fortheexpected losses. To an actuary, these types of events and losses are said to have been incurred, but not reported.","This term is frequently used by insurance companies, particularly along the East and Gulf Coasts of the United States, where hurricanes are common. After a storm hits, actuaries estimate the potential damage to infrastructure and the claims that may be anticipated. Based on this analysis, money is then set aside (in a reserve) to pay for claims. Again, in this example, the actual losses have been incurred, but have not officially been reported."
608,Indemnity,"Indemnity is compensation for damages or loss, and in the legal sense,itmay also refer to an exemptionfrom liability for damages.The concept of indemnity is based on a contractual agreement made between two parties, in which one party agrees to pay for potential losses or damages caused by the other party. A typical example is an insurance contract, whereby one party (the insureror the indemnitor) agrees to compensate the other (the insuredor the indemnitee) for any damages or losses, in return for premiums paid by the insured to the insurer.","An indemnity clause is standard in most insurance agreements. Exactly what is covered, and to what extent, depends on the specific agreement. Any given indemnity agreement has what is called a period of indemnity, or a specific length of time for which the indemnity is valid.Similarly, many contracts include a letter of indemnity, which guarantees that the contract stipulations will be met by both partiesor elsean indemnitymust be paid."
609,Indemnity Insurance,"Indemnity insurance is a contractual agreement in which one party guarantees compensation for actual or potential losses or damages sustained by another party. Most commonly, it is an insurance policy designed to protect professionals and business owners when found to be at fault for a specific event such as misjudgment. Typical examples of indemnity insurance include professional insurance policies like malpractice insurance and errors and omissions insurance. These special insurance policies indemnify or reimburseprofessionals against claims made as they conduct their business.","Indemnity insurance, also referred to as professional liability insurance, is a supplemental form of liability insurance specific to certain professionals or service providers. The professionals provide counsel, expertise, or specialized services. Indemnity insurance is unlike general liability or other forms of commercial liability insurance that protect businesses against claims of bodily harm or property damage. Indemnity insurance protects against claims arising from possible negligence or failure to perform that result in a clients financial loss or legal entanglement. A client who suffers a loss can file a civil claim, and, in response, the professionals indemnity insurance will paylitigation costs as well as any damages awarded by the court."
610,Independent Agent,"An independent agent is aninsurance agent that sells insurance policies provided by several different insurance companies, rather than a single insurance company. An independent agent receives commissions for the policies that he or she sells, and is not considered an employee of a specific insurance company.","Independent insurance agents, like independent financial advisors, are thought to be able to provide their clients with a wider array of options when it comes to insurance products. They take into account the different coverage needs of the client, and select a policy that provides the necessary coverage at a reasonable price. "
611,Independent Insurance Adjuster,"An independent adjuster is called independent because they might not be employed directly by the company, firm, or agency in question but instead by a third-party who specializes in homeowners or other types of insurance claims. They adjust claims on behalfof the insurer, but not directly as an employee of the insurer. When they are contracted as a third party, the insurer is essentially outsourcing the claim and the adjustment process to a claims-handling company, who then turns it over to one of their adjusters.","Homeowners insurancewill cover you against an array of damages sustained, such as damages as a result of a storm or a break-in. Should you have to file a claim for the insurance policy, anadjusterwill come to assess the damage and legitimacy of the claim back to the insurance company. Two types of adjusters will typically perform an inspection— either apublic or independent adjuster. An independent adjuster sounds like the type that would most benefit the homeowner, but the distinction between the two adjusters is often misunderstood."
612,Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America,"The Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America is a U.S.-based, nationwide organization consisting of professionals who sell insurance and financial services products.","The Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America (IIABA) was founded in 1896. IIABA members work independentlyto compare pricing for policies at a variety of insurance companies on behalf of their clients. Unlike direct writers, IIABAmembers are not faithful to a single insurance companys policies and shop around for the best deal they can find for their clients."
613,Industry Loss Warranty,"An industry loss warranty is an insurance or reinsurance contract in which coverage is triggered when the losses experienced by an industry exceed a specific threshold. Industry loss warranties (ILW) are most commonly written by reinsurance companies or hedge funds, since these organizations are able to absorb more losses than smaller insurance companies.","Coverage in an industry loss warranty is typically triggered by a third party reporting that an event has occurred, rather than by the insured indicating that it has experienced a loss. This is because the coverage trigger is not based off of the experience of the insuredand is instead based on losses over a wide number of organizations. The trigger can also be linked to an index other than industry losses, such as the magnitude of an earthquake or the wind speed of a storm."
614,Informed Consent,"Informed consent is permission a medical patient gives to a doctor, hospital, or other medical professional or healthcare provider to receive treatment for a health condition, undergo a test or procedure, or participate in a clinical trial. The American Medical Association stresses that informed consent is a critical aspect of medical treatment, as dictated by both ethics and the law. In addition, this open, ethical communication helps foster a positive relationship between a patient and their health provider.","Informed consent is obtained through a process that typically involves discussions based on the medical professionals diagnosis of the patient's condition and treatment options, the patients ability to understand the diagnosed information, and the patients ability to choose and agree to a treatment."
615,Injury-In-Fact Trigger,Injury-in-fact triggeris a coverage trigger theory that states that an insurance policy coverage activates when an injury or damage actually occurs. An injury-in-fact trigger is used when courts find it difficult to pinpoint the exact time that an injury or damage occurs.,"Injury-in-fact triggers aresometimes referred to as actual injury triggers.Policyholders that seek to recover losses by filing a claim have to prove how and when the loss occurred. In some cases, this may be straightforward with a single, identifiable event leading to the loss occurring. In other cases, it may be difficult to ascertain when an injury or damage occurred, especially if the injury developed over a period of time. Courts use trigger theories in working through these complex situations."
616,Insolvency Clause,An insolvency clause is a reinsurance contract clause that requires the reinsurer to uphold its obligations even if the ceding party becomes insolvent. An insolvency clause mandates the reinsurer must make all payments due. Payment is to the liquidator overseeing the bankrupt ceding party assets.,"Insolvency clauses,as part ofareinsurance contract,assurethat a reinsurance contract remains in force, even in situations in which the ceding insurance company becomes insolvent."
617,Insurance,"Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which an individual or entity receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company. The company pools clients' risks to make payments more affordable for the insured.","Insurance policies are used to hedge against the risk of financial losses, both big and small, that may result from damage to the insured or her property, or from liability for damage or injury caused to a third party."
618,Insurance Bond,"An insurance bond is an insurance-related investment vehicle used primarily in the United Kingdom and Australia. The insurance bond is an investment instrumentoffered by life insurance companiesin the form of a whole life or termlife insurance policy. Insurance bonds best suit investors who use them for estate planning or who are interested in investing for the long term. Also,insurance bonds have some tax advantages.",This product is also known as an investment bond. 
619,Insurance Claim,"An insurance claim is a formal request to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event. The insurance company validates the claim and, once approved, issues payment to the insured or an approved interested party on behalf of the insured.","Insurance claims cover everything from death benefits on life insurance policies to routine and comprehensive medical exams. In many cases, third-parties file claims on behalf of the insured person, but usually only the person(s) listed on the policy is entitled to claim payments."
620,Insurance Company Credit Rating ,"An insurance company credit rating is the opinion of an independent agency regarding the financial strength of an insurance company.An insurance companys credit rating indicates its ability to pay policyholders claims. It does not indicate how well the insurance companys securities are performing forinvestors. In addition, an insurance companys credit rating is considered an opinion, not a fact, and ratings of the same insurance company can differ among rating agencies.","There are four major insurance company rating agencies: Moodys, A.M. Best, Fitch and Standard & Poors (the last two companies also provide corporate credit ratings for investors). Each agency has its own rating scale that doesnt necessarily equate to another companys rating scale, even when the ratings appear similar."
621,Insurance Consortium,"An Insurance Consortium is a group of businesses or organizations that join together to provide insurance coverage. This allows for economies of scale and increased efficiencies, since the groups that are part of the consortium can spread out the cost of administration and can obtain better discounts through volume.","Insurance consortiums are found in both the private and public sectors. They allow groups that would typically self-fund or purchase commercial policies to pool resources in order to obtain better rates. This is especially important with health insurance, since healthcare spending has grown rapidly for several decades. Companies and organizations that are unable to control healthcare costs will find themselves devoting a larger proportion of their budgets to insurance, siphoning awayfunds that could instead be devoted to growth-drivers."
622,Insurance Coverage Area,"Insurance coverage area refers to the geographic region in which an insurance policys benefits apply. The insurance coverage area for a travel health insurance plan, for example, might be defined asanywhere in the world. This definition means that the policyholder can obtain medically necessary treatment anywhere and be entitled to the policys benefits, assuming the policys other conditions are met. Insurance coverage area is also known as""coverage territory.""","A common situation where insurance coverage area is important is student health insurance. If a student, who is covered under her parents health insurance policy in Texas, is attending school in California, the policy would not cover a students visit to an emergency room while she was at school if California was outside the plans coverage area. The student might need to purchase a separate health insurance plan through the university to get local insurance coverage for medical treatment."
623,Insurance Cutoff,"Insurance cutoff is areinsurance contract provision that prevents the reinsurer from being liable for claims after the contract termination date. An insurance cutoff, also called a cut-off cancelation, defines how long the reinsurer will have financial responsibilities from insurance policies that were in force while the reinsurance contract was in effect.","Reinsurance contracts often have a termination provision included in the contract language in order to define when the financial responsibilities of the reinsurer end. This provision is an important feature because some claims, such as those related to personal injury, may take place years after the reinsurance contract has expired."
624,Insurance Derivative,"An insurance derivative is a financial instrument that derives its value from an underlying insurance index or the characteristics of an event related to insurance. Insurance derivatives are useful for insurance companies that want to hedge their exposure to catastrophic losses due to exceptional events, such as earthquakes or hurricanes.","Unlike financial derivatives, which typically use marketable securities as their underlying assets, insurance derivatives base their value on a predetermined insurance-related statistic. For example, an insurance derivative could offer a cash payout to its owner if a specific index of hurricane losses reached a target level. This would protect an insurance company from catastrophic losses if an exceptional hurricane caused unforeseen amounts of damage.Another example of an insurance derivative would beorange growers in Florida, who rely on derivatives to hedge their exposure to bad weather that could destroy an entire seasons crop. The orange growerspurchase derivatives that allow them to benefit if the weather damages or destroys their crop. If the weather is good, and the result is a bumper crop, then the groweris only out the cost of purchasing the derivative."
625,Insurance Grace Period,"An insurance grace period is a defined amount of time after the premium is due in which a policyholder can make a premium payment without coverage lapsing.The insurance grace period can vary depending on the insurer and policy type. Depending on the insurance policy, the grace period can be as little as 24 hours or as long as 30 days. The amount of time granted in aninsurance grace period is indicated in the insurance policy contract. Paying after the due date may attract a financial penalty from the insurance company.","Insurance grace periods protect policyholders from immediately losing coverage incasethey are late with a premium payment. Regulations covering insurance grace periods, including how long they must last across policy types, are managed by states. Some states may allow insurers to drop policyholders immediately,without advanced notice if premiums are not paid on time."
626,Insurance Guaranty Association,"An insurance guaranty association is a state-sanctionedorganization that protects policyholders and claimants in the case of an insurance companys impairment or insolvency. Insurance guarantyassociations are legal entities, whose members make guarantees and provide a mechanism to resolve claims.","Insurance guarantyassociations provide an important backstop in the insurance market. An association is given its powers by the state insurance commissioner, with its duties and obligations outlined in a plan of operation. A board of directors is appointed in order to ensure the organization is able to effectively and efficiently meet the statutory expectations listed in the plan of operation. The association presents an annual report to the state insurance commissioner, outlining the activities that it had undertaken during the year, as well as outlining its income and any disbursements it may have made."
627,Insurance Inflation Protection,Insurance inflation protection is an insurance policy feature in which the value of benefits increases by a pre-defined percentage at specific time periods. Insurance inflation protection is designed to allow policyholders to make sure that the benefits they receive can keep up with the inflation rate.,"Individuals are most likely going to look for insurance inflation protection options when shopping for long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance is typically purchased years before benefits are drawn upon, but the future costs of medical care twenty or thirty years from today may greatly exceed the policy benefit. Inflation protection is designed to limit the negative effects of more expensive medical care in the future."
628,Insurance Loss Control,Insurance loss control encompasses risk management practices designed to reduce the likelihood of a claim being made against an insurance policy. Loss control involves identifying the sources of riskand is accompanied by either voluntary or required actions that a client or policyholder should undertake in order to reduce risk.,"Insurance loss control helps reduce risk, and insurance companies and policyholders both benefit. Insurance companies help identify activities that can result in a claim being filed, and thus reduce the odds of having to pay out claims and dip into profits. Policyholders benefit from being more risk averse by having their premiums lowered."
629,Insurance Premium,"An insurance premium is the amount of money that an individual or business must pay for an insurance policy. The insurance premium isincome forthe insurance company, once it is earned, and also represents a liability in that the insurer must provide coverage for claims being made against the policy.","The priceof an insurance premium for a given insurancepolicy can vary and dependson a variety of factors. Among those factors arethe type of insurance coverage, the likelihood of a claim being made, the area where the policyholder lives or operates a business, the behavior of the person or business being covered, and the amount of competition that the insurer faces.For example, the likelihood of a claim being made against a teenage driver living in an urban area may be higher or lower compared to a teenage driverin a suburban area. In general, the greater the risk associated with a policy, the more expensive the insurance policy will be."
630,Insurance Proceeds,"Insurance proceeds arebenefit proceeds paid out by any type of insurance policy as a result of a claim. Insurance proceeds are paid out once a claim has been verified, and financially indemnify the insured for a loss that is covered under the policy. Insurance proceeds are sometimes paid directly to a care provider (as with health insurance), but usually, it issent to the insured in the form of a check.",Insurance proceeds require some specific accounting procedures.
631,Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS),"Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS), is a collection of databases and tools used to analyze the financial statements of insurance companies. It is managed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and has been available since 1972. It is primarily used by regulators to determine the solvency of insurance companies.","The Insurance Regulatory Information System mines the financial information filed by insurance companies in order to calculate ratios that can be used to determine which insurance companies face solvency issues. IRIS determines a range of ratio values that are considered acceptable, with outlying values indicating that an insurer should be examined more closely."
632,Insurance Risk Class,"An insurance risk class is a group of individuals or companies that have similar characteristics, which areused to determine the risk associated with underwriting a new policy and the premium that should be charged for coverage. Determining the insurance risk classis a primary component of an insurance companys underwriting process.","While no two individuals are exactly thesame, many people exhibit similarities that allow them to be classified. Insurance companies need to know the likelihood that underwriting a new policy for a new client or business will be a profitable endeavor. After all, taking on a new policy forseveral hundred dollars a year won't be a good idea if the policyholder winds up creating thousands of dollars in claims."
633,Insurance Score,"An insurance score, also, known as insurance credit score, is a rating computed and used by insurance companies that represents the probability of an individual filing an insurance claimwhile under coverage. The score is based on the individuals credit ratingand will affect the premiums they pay for the coverage. A higher score will result in lower premiums and vice versa.","An insurance score is a key component to the total premiumthat an individual will pay for health, homeowners, autoand life insurance policies. Insurance companies determine an individuals scorein part by usingproperty claim databases like the Automated Property Loss Underwriting System, or A-PLUS, and the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, or CLUE."
634,Insurance Trust,"An insurance trust is anirrevocable trust set up with a life insurance policy as the asset, allowing the grantor of the policy to exempt asset away from his or her taxable estate.Once the life insurance policy is placed in the trust, the insured person no longer owns the policy, which will be managed by the trustee on behalf of the policy beneficiaries when the insured person dies.","The insurance trust, or irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT), is often used to set aside cash proceeds that can be used to pay estate taxes, as the life insurance policy should be exempt from the taxable estate of the decedent.One catch ofaninsurance trust is that the life insurance policy must be transferred to the trust at least three years before the death of the insured. To get around this rule, a new policy can be taken out with a spouse as owner, then placed in the trust."
635,Insurance Underwriter,"Insurance underwriters are professionals who evaluate and analyze the risks of insuring people and assets and establish pricing for accepted insurable risks.Underwriters help price life insurance, health insurance, commercial liability insurance, homeowners insurance, et al. Underwriters use computer programs and actuarial data to determine the likelihood and magnitude of claim payouts over the life of the policy. Evaluating an insurer's risk before the policy period and at renewal is a vital function of an underwriter.","Insurance companies face the precarious dilemma of either being too aggressive or too conservative in their underwriting duties. If too aggressive, greater-than-expected claims could compromise earnings; if too conservative, they will be outpriced by competitors and lose market share. Insurance underwriting is a large and profitable industry. For example, Warren Buffett used insurance and reinsurance premiums to fund investments at Berkshire Hathaway."
636,Insured Financial Institution,An insured financial institution is any bank or savings institution covered by some form of deposit insurance.,"State and national banks, must be insured financial institutions, required by law to have Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage. The Deposit Insurance Fund insures the deposits and protects the depositors of insured banks and resolves failed banks. Credit unions are covered by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, or NCUSIF."
637,Intellectual Property Rights (Biotechnology),"Biotechnology intellectual property rights is the legal ownership of an interest in a patent, trademark or trade secret. This means that another company cannot use those assets without permission of the company established as the official owner. In health care, intellectual property rights give their owners exclusive use of pharmaceuticals, brand names and more. Intellectual property rights are often the primary driver of value for these companies, particularly in biotech.","Biotechnology intellectual property rights provide health care companies with a means to protect their claim to and ownership of these assets through common law, state law or federal law. There is some controversy over intellectual property rights in biotechnology. Those in favor argue that they provide a key incentive for developers to innovate, because these protections will allow them to be financially rewarded for successful innovations. Those opposed to the strict enforcement of these protections argue that broader sharing of information would reduce prices and increase access to care, especially in developing countries."
638,Interbank Network for Electronic Transfer - INET,Interbank Network for Electronic Transfer (INET) processed Mastercards credit anddebitcard transactions between financial institutions. Banknet is the current facility.,"Interbank Network for Electronic Transfer (INET) covered transactions made by a debit or credit card bearing the Mastercard logo. INET made the transfer of funds, while Mastercards International's card authorization system, or INAS, system processed the card authorizations. They were combined into Banknet. Mastercard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network linking all Mastercard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network."
639,Intercompany Products Suits Exclusion,"An intercompany products suits exclusion is aninsurance policy endorsement that excludes coverage for claims made by one named insured against another named insured. Intercompany products suits exclusions are most commonly found in insurance policies purchased by companies with large operations, especially operations in which subsidiaries buy and sell goods and services to other subsidiaries.","Intercompany products suits exclusions are most frequently attached to commercial policies, such as general liability and commercial umbrella policies. Commercial liability policies typically treat each insured and named insureds as if they each had their own policy."
640,Interest-Crediting Methods,"An interest-crediting methoddetermines how interest changes to a fixed index annuity (FIA) are measured. The interest-crediting method chosen measures the amount of interest that the annuity holder can receive over a specific time period.Annuity contracts have a number of provisions that affect how interest is treated. Most contacts include a combination of caps (maximum interest allowed), participation rates (fraction of interest credited to the contract)and spreads. These limit the upside potential of increases in index value.","In a point-to-point interest-crediting method, any increase in the value of an index is calculated from two points in time. This is the simplest interest-crediting method to calculate, but it may not provide anannuity contract holder with the most benefit. For example, if an index was valued at 1,000 at the beginning of the time period and increased to 1,150 by the end, the point-to-point method would call this a 15 percentincrease (150/1000 x 100). If the index decreases in value no interest will be added to the contract, though the contract wont lose its value."
641,Interlocking Clause,An interlocking clause is a provision in a reinsurance treaty used to determine how to allocate a loss between two or more reinsurance treaties. Interlocking clauses are useful when a loss comes from a single occurrence.,"The manner in which insurance companies treat time can be complicated, with differences in accident years, reporting years, and underwriting years impacting the treatment of losses. In some cases, an insurer may purchase multiple reinsurance treaties to cover the same risk over different time periods. Since there are several reinsurancetreaties, the insurer must apportion loss among them. Spreading loss among contracts is possible due to the inclusion of an interlocking clause in the reinsurance treaties. Interlocking clauses will most likely occur when the insurer purchases reinsurance on an underwriting year basis."
642,Intermediary Clause,An intermediary clause is a provision that identifies the individuals or companies acting as a broker in a reinsurance contract. An intermediary clause states whether the payment made by one party in the reinsurance agreement to the broker is paid to the other party.,"Insurance companies have two primary options when working with reinsurance companies. They may work together directly, or they may work through an intermediary."
643,Investment Income Ratio,Investment income ratio is the ratio of an insurance companys net investment income to its earned premiums. The investment income ratio compares the income that an insurance company brings in from its investment activities rather than its operations. It is used to determine the profitability of an insurance company.,"The investment income ratio is used in the calculation of an insurance companys overall operating ratio, which is a measurement of the insurers overall performance. The overall operating ratio is equal to the combined ratio (the sum of the loss ratio and expense ratio) less the investment income ratio. An operating ratio below 100 indicates that the insurer is generating profit from its operations."
644,Investment Income Sharing,Investment income sharing refers to profits made through the investment activities of a mutual insurance arrangement that is distributed to plan participants.,"Investment income sharing is most commonly associated with insurance services that comply with Islamic financial rules, specifically takaful."
645,Investment in the Contract,"Investment in the contract as applied to annuities is the principal amount the holder has invested. It can be made by payments or a lump sum. This term generally applies to fixed, indexed and variable annuities alike.",Any amount of money withdrawn from an annuity that is in excess of the investment in the contract is considered a taxable distribution. Investors who annuitize their contracts will see a portion of each payment they receive classified as a return of principal or investment in the contract. This portion of each payment is considered a tax-free return of principal.
646,Invisible Hard Market,An invisible hard market refers to rising prices for property and casualty insurance that fails to result in higher profits for insurers.,"Under normal circumstances, limited supply for insurance results in more underwriting income for insurers, as well as more net profit. In an invisible hard market, the net profit either doesnt budge or declines, largely due to weak demand or abnormal market conditions."
647,Irrevocable Beneficiary,An irrevocable beneficiary is a beneficiary in a life insurance policy or segregated fund contract. The beneficiarymust agree to any changes in rights to compensation from these entities.,"An irrevocable beneficiary has certain guaranteed rights to assets held in the policy or fund. Unlike a revocablebeneficiary, where theirright to assets can be denied or amended under certain circumstances."
648,Issue-Age Policy,"An issue-age policy is ahealthcarepolicy which has a premium ratedependent on the age of the individual who purchases it. Issue-age pricing frequently comes into play when pricing Medigap policies. These policies are more expensive for older individuals than they are for a younger person. Once bought, the issue-age policy does not increase in price any further based on age. However, the premium payments typically increase as the cost of healthcare services rises due to many factors. Many companies who offerMedicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI)also known as Medigap insurance will use issue-age as one of the pricing models for the contracts they sell.","Insurance providers who underwrite issue-age policieswill tie the cost the policy to an individual's age because, statistically, older policyholders are more likely to require medical treatment."
649,Jewelry Floater,A jewelry floater is a term used in the insurance industry to describe supplemental insurance covering precious jewelry.,"A jewelry floater is an optional addition to a homeowner's insurance policy that protects against financial loss from the damage or theft of valuable jewelry. Though a basic homeowners policy provides some jewelry coverage, if an individual has a sizable and valuable jewelry collection they should add a jewelry floater on top of their basic policy. The jewelry floater will provide a higher dollar amount of coverage for jewelry than a basic homeowners insurance policy does."
650,Jobless Claims,"Jobless claims are a statistic reported weekly by the U.S. Department of Labor that counts people filing to receive unemployment insurance benefits. There are two categories of jobless claims –initial, which comprises people filing for the first time, and continuing, which consists of unemployed people who have been receiving unemployment benefits for a while. Jobless claims are an important leading indicator on the state of the employment situation and the health of the economy. Average weekly initial jobless claims are one of the 10 components of theConference Board Leading Economic Index.","The nation's jobless claims is an extremely important indicator for a macroeconomic analysis. Themonthly Bureau of Labor Statistics'""Employment Report""tracks how many new people have filed forunemployment benefitsin the previous week. It is a good gauge of the U.S. job market. For instance, when more people file for unemployment benefits, fewer people have jobs, and vice versa. Investors can use this report to gather pertinent information about the economy, but it's a very volatile data, so the moving four-week average of jobless claims is monitored.The report is released at 8:30 a.m. ETon Thursdays and can be a market moving event."
651,Joint-Life Payout,"A joint-life payout is one of two options normally available for retirees to choose as the method of payout for their employee retirement benefits. The joint-life payout option allows the retiree to receive benefits during the remainder of his/her life and guarantees income for another person after he/she has died, most often this other person is the retiree's spouse. Unless the retiree's statements explicitly states the joint-life payout, the default payout option is the single-life option.","By contrast, a single-life option will pay out benefits to a retiree starting at retirement, but the payouts cease upon the retiree's death. Choosing a payout option is an important decision and several factors should be taken into consideration, such as health, anticipated life expectancy and family's financial circumstances."
652,Justified Complaint (Home Insurance),"A justified complaint is a formal grievance made against an insurance company for a violation of contract terms. A justified complaint happens when a policyholder has a valid concern regarding how the insurer conducts and manages its businesses and upholds its contract agreements. On the other hand, a complaint, or grievance, is unjustified if there is no apparent violation of an insurers contractual obligations.","There are numerous possibilities for insurer wrongdoing. Policyholders should file complaints with state governing authorities when an insurer falsely represents its position as a coverage provider. Not every policyholder knows when an insurance company has violated its contractual position as some company representatives may convincingly give appropriate and seemingly reasonable recommendations and solutions to inquiries. Some violations by insurance companies could be subtle and undetected, while other offenses could be overt. A policyholder who uncovers wrongdoing may choose to file a complaint with their states insurance department."
653,Kenney Rule,The Kenney rule is a ratio of an insurance companys unearned premiums to its policyholders surplus that is said to reduce insolvency risk.,"The Kenney rule, also known as the Kenney ratio, is a guiding principle used by insurance companies. The ratio varies according to the insurance lines, but is traditionally considered to be a 2-to-1 ratio of net premiums to surplus."
654,Key Person Insurance,"A life insurance policy that a company purchases on a key executive's life. The company is the beneficiary of the plan and pays the insurance policy premiums. This type of life insurance is alsoknown as ""key man insurance,"" ""key woman insurance"" or ""business life insurance.""",Key person insurance is needed if the sudden loss of a key executive would have a large negative effect on the company's operations. The payout provided from the death of the executive essentially buys the company time to find a new person or to implement other strategies to save the business.
655,Kidnap Insurance,Kidnap insurance is a kind of insurance coverage designed to protect individuals from the risk of kidnapping.,"Kidnap insurance often covers other events related to kidnapping, including extortion. Kidnap insurance may often be bundled with protection for several other related perils, so sometimes it is offered askidnap and ransom insurance, known as K&R insurance, or askidnap, ransom and extortion insurance."
656,Laddering,"Laddering is the promotion of inflated pre-IPO prices for the sake of obtaining a greater allotment of the offering. Laddering is an illegal IPO practice in which the underwriter engages in the sale of IPO shares to clients with the implicit agreement that more shares will be purchased post IPO, leading to big gains for both parties. Once the price increases a certain level, ""insiders"" then sell their shares and take their profits.","An underwriter will push up the issue price of an IPO through promotion, in order to please the issuer and secure a larger allotment. By agreeing to allocate additional shares to choice clients, the underwriter and clients can make big gains on the IPO shares, while the firm offering shares in the IPO are happy with the underwriter for creating increased market value."
657,Lapse Ratio,"Lapse ratio is the number of policies that are that are not renewed compared to the number of policies that were active at the beginning of that same period. The lapse ratio represents the percentage of policies that were not renewed, and thus have lapsed in coverage. Lapsed policies are not the same as canceled policies.","Insurance companies strive to keep loss ratio low byhavingtheir policyholders consistently renew their policies since policy renewals mean continued earnings. If an insurer sent renewal notices to 1000 current automobile insurance policy holders and 700 of those policies are renewed, the lapse ratio is (1000-700)/(1000), or 30 percent. The lapse ratio considered acceptable to an insurance company can vary by type of policy, geography andother factors."
658,Large-Line Capacity Insurance,Large-line capacity insurance is a single policy that covers a potential for a large amount of loss. Often it is the maximum amount of liability an insurer can assume in a single policy. Large-line capacity is also insurance coverage that protects an insurer's ability to underwrite a large amount of risk under a single policy.,"Underwritten policies are most commonly for relatively small amounts of risk. For example,homeownersinsurance thresholds typically do not exceed several million dollars.Sometimes, however, an insurer may provide large-line coverage for a single policy.Underwriting more substantial policies introduce a different set of risks than do smaller policies."
659,Lead Reinsurer,"The leadreinsurer responsible for negotiating the terms and rates of a reinsurance treaty that other reinsurers participate in. The lead reinsurer, also known as the lead underwriter, is the first party to sign the reinsurance slip or contract.","While lead reinsurers are responsible for negotiating the reinsurance treaty, they are not required to take the largest share of the risk. They may be granted the authority to modify the reinsurance contract after it is signed, with any modifications considered binding on all other reinsurers. The choice of a lead reinsurer usually depends on their level of expertise and experience. A direct underwriter would most often choose a lead reinsurer with whom risks can be placed faster."
660,Lead Underwriter,"A lead underwriter is aninvestment bank or other financial outfit that has the primary directive for organizing an initial public stock offering, or a secondary offering for companies that are already publicly traded.","The lead underwriter will usually work with other investment banks to establish anunderwritersyndicate, and thereby create the initial sales force for the shares. These shares will then be sold to institutional and retail clients.The lead underwriter will assess the company financials and current market conditions to arrive at the initial value and quantity of shares to be sold. These shares carry a hefty sales commission (as much as 6 to8 percent) for the underwritersyndicate, with the majority of shares being held by the lead underwriter."
661,Least Expensive Alternative Treatment (LEAT),"A least expensive alternative treatment (LEAT)clause in an insurance policy that indicates that the insurer will only cover the least expensive option for treatment, repair, or remediation. LEATonly applies when multiple options are available. It is also referred to as the least expensive professionally acceptable alternative treatment (LEPAAT).","The least expensive alternative treatment clause is used to keep costs low for an insurer.Managing the costs of benefits is an important factor for insurance companies as they underwrite new policies. They build risk profiles for individuals based on their characteristics, such as age and gender, as well as other factors including type of employment, amount of travel, and where the person lives. This insurance risk profile is used to determine the likelihood of an individual making an insurance claim, which is used in setting the premium charged for a policy."
662,Legacy Costs,Legacy costs are ongoing costs that arise from spending that does not increase revenue. Pension plans are a prime example of a legacy cost.,"Legacy costs are typically costs involved with a company paying increased health-care fees and other benefit-related costs for its current employees and retired pensioners. Escalating legacy costs can be a large contributing factor towards limiting a company's competitiveness; yet while these costs can have a negative impacton a company'sbottom line, workers rights advocates point out the ethical obligation of employers to support their employees with these types of funding activities."
663,Level Death Benefit,"A level death benefit is a life insurance payout that is the same whenever the insured person dies, whether shortly after purchasing the policy or many years later. Compared to a policy that provides an increasing death benefit, one that provides a level death benefit will be less expensive (that is, the premiums will be lower for the same amount of initial benefit). However, inflation will diminish the value of the level death benefit over time.",A level death benefit is one of two death-benefit options available under many universal life insurance policies; the other is an increasing death benefit.
664,Level-Premium Insurance,Level-premium insurance is a type of term life insurance for which the premiums remain the same throughout the duration of the contract. The premium paid on this type of policy will be higher at the beginning of its life but lower towards the end of its life as compared to term policies that have rising premium rates. ,"This policy is a type of term life insurance, meaning it provides coverage only for a specified duration and it has only a death benefit, no savings component. Therefore, when looking at level-premium insurance, you should carefully consider the length of coverage best suited to your needs. For example, if the primary purpose of the death benefit is to provide income to support very young children and/or fund college expenses, a 20-year level premium might be appropriate. However, if these children are already in their early teens, you may need only a 10-year level premium. "
665,Liability Insurance,Liability insurance is insurance that provides protection against claims resulting from injuries and damage to people and/or property.,Liability insurance policies cover both legal costs and any legal payouts for which the insured would be responsible if found legally liable. Intentional damage and contractual liabilities are typically not covered in these types of policies.
666,Liberalization Clause,A liberalization clause is an insurance policy provision allowing adjustments to existing coverage to comply with changes to laws and regulations. Property insurance is the most likely place tofind a liberalization clause.,"In the United States, each state primarily regulates the sale of insurance policies. State laws determine required coverages and limits, set liquidity requirements insurance companies must meet to sell policies, and govern insurer insolvencies."
667,Licensed For Reinsurance Only,Licensed for reinsurance only is a license that allows a company to engage in services related to reinsurance in the state that has granted the license. This means they are strictly limited to operating only within that particular role.,"Licensed for reinsurance only applies to reinsurance brokers who negotiate reinsurance cessions on behalf of a ceding insurer, as well as reinsurance managers who manage the reinsurance business of a reinsurer."
668,Life Expectancy,"Life expectancy is the statistical age that a person is expected to live. Uses for life expectancy include many in the financial world. In most countries, the calculation of the statistical age isfrom a national statistical agency.","Life expectancy is used by insurance companies to determineinsurance premiums. Using tables provided by the Internal Revenue Service, these companies try to minimize theliability risk."
669,Life Insurance,Life insurance is a contract between an insurer and a policyholder in which the insurer guarantees payment of a death benefit to named beneficiaries upon the death of the insured. The insurance company promises a death benefit in consideration of the payment of premium by the insured.,"The purpose of life insurance is to provide financial protection to surviving dependents after the death of an insured. It is essential for applicants to analyze their financial situation and determine the standard of living needed for their surviving dependents before purchasing a life insurance policy. Life insurance agents or brokers are instrumental in assessing needs and establishing the type of life insurance most suitable to address those needs. Several life insurance channels are available includingwhole life, term life, universal life, and variable universal life (VUL)policies. It is prudent to re-evaluate life insurance needs annually, or aftersignificant life events like marriage, divorce, the birth or adoption of a child, and major purchases, like a house."
670,Life Option,"The life option is one example of an annuitized payout scheme for an annuity contract. This option guarantees periodic payments to the annuitant for the remainder of their life. Since that timeline is, by definition, unknown, the life option involves some financial risk for both the annuitant and the insurance company making those payments.","A life option is one of several payout schedules available to the owner of an annuity contract. Annuities are insurance products that investors typically purchase to provide a post-retirement income stream. The investor contributes to the annuity periodically or in a lump-sum contribution, then enjoys tax-deferred growth on that investment. The appeal of annuities lies in the certainty of the payouts, regardless of which of the various payout structure the annuitant selects. Among these payout plans, the life option is unique in that the length of the payout period is unknown. The investor will receive payments until they die. Unlike the payout period, the payout amount is known. This means that an annuitant who chooses the life option for payouts will earn more from their investment if they live long enough for their payouts to exceed their contributions to the policy."
671,Life Settlement,"A life settlement is the selling of one's life insurance policy to a third party for a one time cash payment. The purchaser then becomes the beneficiary of the policy and begins paying the premiums. Typically the purchaser is an experienced institutional investor, and policies will have face amounts in excess of $250,000.A life settlement is similar to a ""viatical settlement"".","Life settlements are usually only done when the insured person doesn't have a known life-threatening illness. They are often done with ""key individual"" insurance policies held by companies on executives, who no longer work there. The company has a chance to cash out on a policy that was previously illiquid.Sometimes people outgrow their need for a specific life insurance policy, and a life settlement may offer the chance to gain more than the policy's cash surrender value."
672,Lifetime Reserve Days,Lifetime reserve days are the number of hospital days that an insurance policy will cover above the number of days allotted per benefit period. These days are capped at a certain number over the entire lifetime of the policy. They do not have to be used during a particular hospital stay.,"Lifetime reserve days are most often associated with Medicare policies. When an insured person enters a medical facility, such as a hospital, the benefit period begins, lasting until the person leaves the facility. If the policyholder needs to stay longer than the days allotted per benefit period, he or she may continue to stay using the lifetime reserve days. For example, if a patient stays in the hospital or nursing facility for 100 days but is only allotted 90 days per benefit period, the patient will have to use 10 lifetime reserve days."
673,Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Arrangement (LPFSA),"A Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Arrangement (LPFSA) is a savings plan to be used with an HSA. It is reserved for the payment of dental and vision expenses. A limited purpose FSA is a more restrictive version of a standard health flexible spending account (FSA). Unlike a standard FSA, employees may use an LPFSA in conjunction with a Health Savings Account (HSA).","Qualified dental and vision expenses include dental cleanings, fillings, vision exams, contact lenses, and prescription glasses. Some employers also allow plan participants to use LPFSA funds to pay for qualified medical expenses once the participantmeets his or her health insurance deductible. The limitation exists becauseHSA holderscannot have medical coverage other than a high-deductible health insurance plan, dental insurance, and vision insurance. There are a few other less common exceptions."
674,Lloyd's Of London,"Lloyd's of London is a British insurance market where members join hands as syndicates to insure and spread risks of different businesses, organizations and individuals. The syndicates are specialized in different types of risks and each syndicate decides which type of risk to insure. Its main purpose is to act as an intermediary between clients, underwriters, brokers and insurance companies.",
675,Lloyds Organizations,"Lloyds Organizations is an insurance syndicate that bases its organizational structure on the one used by Lloyds of London. Also called Lloyds associations or American Lloyds, are funded by subscriptions paid by members who participate in underwriting activities. The subscriptions are used to pay general expenses, such as administrative and office expenses. A Lloyds organization should not be confused with Lloyds of London, which is an international insurance marketing organization.","Lloyds organizations act as insurance markets rather than insurance companies. Insurance underwriters and brokers conduct transactions that are facilitated by their membership in the same organization. The organization may focus on a particular type of insurance, such as property or fire, or may involve several types of insurance."
676,Lock-Up Period,A lock-up period is a window of time when investors in a hedge fund or another closely held investment vehicle are not allowed to redeem or sell shares. The lock-up period helps portfolio managers avoid liquidity problems while capital is put to work in sometimes illiquid investments.,The initial public offering (IPO) lock-up is a typical lock-up period in the equities market used for newly issued public shares. It typically lasts anywhere from 90 to 180 days after the first day of trading so that fund managers can keep a lower amount of cash on hand.
677,Long-Tail Liability,A long-tail liability is type of liability that carries a long settlement period. Long-tail liabilities are likely to result in high incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims because it may take a long period of time for the claims to be settled.,"Whether a settlement period for an insurance claim is considered a long-tailliability or short termwidely varies according to the type of risk being covered.Property insurance claims tend to be settled relatively quickly, while liability insurance claims are oftenclassified as long-tail liabilities."
678,Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance,"Long-term care (LTC) insurance is coverage that provides nursing-home care, home-health care, personal or adult day care for individuals above the age of 65 or with a chronic or disabling condition that needs constant supervision. LTC insurance offers more flexibility and options than many public assistance programs.","Long-term care is usually very expensive, which is why most people need insurance. For example, on average, nursing facilities providing skilled care charge $150 to $300 per day –more than $80,000 peryear or more. Custodial home care at three visits per week can cost more than $9,000 eachyear. Most LTC insurance policies will cover only a specific dollar amount for each day you spend in a nursing facility or for each home-care visit. Thus, when considering an LTC insurance policy, read the policies carefully and compare the benefits to determine which policy will best meet your own needs."
679,Longevity Risk,"Longevity risk is risk to which a pension fund or life insurance company could be exposed as a result of higher-than-expected payout ratios. Longevity risk exists due to the increasing life expectancy trends among policyholders and pensioners, and can result in payout levels that are higher than what a company or fund originally accounts for. The types of plans exposed to the greatest levels of longevity risk are defined-benefit pension plans and annuities, which guarantee lifetime benefits for policy or plan holders.","Average life expectancy figures are on the rise, but even a very small change in life expectancies can create severe solvency issues for pension plans and insurance companies. Precise measurements of longevity risk are still unattainable becausethe limitations of medicine and its impact on life expectancies has not been quantified."
680,Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,"The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal law that gives medical and other benefits to certain maritime employees. The LHWCAcovers longshoremen, harbor workers, and many other maritime employees. Other employeesincludethose who load and unload ships, truck drivers who haul shipping containers away from the docks andalso civilian employees on military bases as part of the Defense Base Act.","The compensation act pays benefits to injured workers who have temporary or permanent partial or total disabilities. The paid benefits cover a portion of lost wages, all reasonable and necessary medicaltreatments, and travel expenses associated with receiving those medical treatments. If a worker cannot return to maritime employment after an injury, the act also provides free job retraining. TheLHWCAalsocovers surviving spouses of employees who died of work-related injuries."
681,Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE),"A loss adjustment expense (LAE) is an expense associated with investigating and settling an insurance claim.Loss adjusted expenses that are allocated to a specific claim are called allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE), while expenses not allocated to a specific claim are called unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE).","When insurers receive a claim, they don't open their checkbooks immediately. They do their due diligence to ensure that the amount of damages claimed by the policyholder are accurate. Theysend out investigators to ensurewhat was claimed actually did happen. Not conducting an investigation could lead to losses from fraudulent claims."
682,Loss And Loss-Adjustment Reserves To Policyholders' Surplus Ratio,"Loss and loss-adjustment reserves to policyholders' surplus ratio is the ratio of an insurers reserves set aside for unpaid losses and the cost of investigation and adjusting for losses to its assets after accounting for liabilities. Also called the reserves to policyholders surplus, indicates how much risk each dollar of surplus supports. The ratio is usually expressed as a percentage.","Insurance companies set aside a reserve to cover potential liabilities from claims made on policies that they underwrite. The reserves are based on an estimate of the losses an insurer may face over a period of time, meaning that the reserves could be adequate or may fall short of covering its liabilities. Estimating the amount of reserves requires actuarial projections based upon the types of policies underwritten."
683,Loss Constant,"Loss constant is an amount added to an insurance policy with a low premium designed to cover higher-than-expected loss experiences. The loss constant helps protect insurers from losses associated with small risks, and is most commonly used in workers compensation policies.",Insurance companies determine the premium to charge for a new policy by examining the risk associated with covering a specific peril. The historical severity and frequency of losses associated with the risk are built into the models that insurers use to calculate premiums.
684,Loss Cost,"Loss cost, also known as pure premium or pure cost, is the amount of money an insurer must pay to cover claims, including the costs to administer and investigate such claims. Loss cost, along with other factors, is used to calculate premiums.","Rate making, or determining the amount of premium to charge, is one of the most critical tasks an insurer faces. It requires insurers to examine historical settlement costs, known as the insurers loss cost. The loss cost represents payments to cover claims made on the underwritten policies. Loss cost also includes administrative expenses associated with investigating and adjusting claims. It is, therefore, theactualcost required to cover a claim."
685,Loss Development,"Loss development is the difference between the final losses recorded by an insurer and what the insurer originally recorded. Loss development seeks to account for the fact that some insurance claims take a long time to settle, and that estimates of the total loss that an insurer will experience will adjust as claims are finalized.","Insurance companies use loss development factorsin insurance pricing and reserving to adjust claims to their projected finallevel.Insurers have to take a number of factorsinto account when determining what, if any, losses they may face from the insurance policies that they underwrite. One of the most important factors is the amount of time that it takes to process a claim.While claims may be reported, processed and closed during a particular policy period, they may also be reported in later policy periods and may not be settled for a long period of time. This can make reporting complicated and, at best, based off an approximation of the loss that the insurer will ultimately experience."
686,Loss Payable Clause,A loss payable clause is an insurance contract endorsement where an insurer pays a third party for a loss instead of the named insured or beneficiary. The loss payable provision limits the rights of the loss payee to be no higher than the rights guaranteed to the insured.,"A loss payable clause indicates that a third party, referred to as the loss payee, receives funds paid for a loss. The loss payee received funds because it has an assignment of interest in the insured property. This is commonly found inproperty insurance contracts, specifically for financed properties, where the mortgageholder is the loss payee. Because a lien exists on the property, the loss payee is also known as the lien holder."
687,Loss Payee,"The loss payee is the party to whom the claim from a loss is to be paid. A loss payee can mean several different things; in the insurance industry, the insured or the party entitled to payment is the loss payee. The insured can expect reimbursement from the insurance carrier in the event of a loss.","Loss payee can be different from ""first loss payee,"" which is the party that must be paid first when a debtor defaults on a loan. Loss payeeis simply a generic phrase signifying the rightful recipient of any kind of reimbursement and is most often used in the auto insurance industry."
688,Loss Portfolio Transfer,"A loss portfolio transfer (LPT) is areinsurance treaty in which an insurer cedes policies that have already incurred losses to a reinsurer. In a loss portfolio transfer, a reinsurer assumes and accepts an insurers existing open and future claim liabilities through the transfer of the insurers loss reserves. It is a type of alternative risk financing.","Insurers use loss portfolio transfers to remove liabilities from their balance sheets, with the most common reasons being to transfer risk from a parent to a captive or to exit a line of business. The liabilities may already exist (such as claims that have been processed but not yet paid) or may soon appear (such as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims)."
689,Loss Ratio ,"The loss ratio is the ratio of losses to gains. One example is the ratio of paid insurance claims, including adjustment expenses, to premiums earned. To demonstrate, if a company pays $80 in claims for every $160 in collected premiums, the loss ratio is 50%.","Loss ratios vary depending on the type of insurance. For example, the loss ratio for health insurance tends to be higher than the loss ratio for property and casualty insurance. Loss ratios help assess the health and profitability of an insurance company. Favorably, a business collects premiums higher than amounts paid in claims. High loss ratios may indicate that a business is in financial distress."
690,Loss Reserve,"Loss reserve is an estimate of an insurers liability from future claims. Loss reserves are typically comprised of liquid assets, and theyallow the insurer to cover claims made against policies that it underwrites. Estimating liabilities can be a complex undertaking. Insurers must take into account the duration of the insurance contract, the type of insurance offeredand the odds ofa claim beingresolved quickly. Insurers have to adjust their loss reserve calculations as circumstances change.","When an insurer underwrites a new policy, it records a premium receivable (which is an asset) and a claim obligation (which is a liability). The liability is considered part of the unpaid losses account, which represents the loss reserve."
691,Loss Settlement Amount,"Loss settlement amount is a term used to denote the amount of a propertyinsurance settlement, whether real estate or personal property. The loss settlement amount largely depends on which type of loss cost settlement option a policyholderhasagreed to in theirhomeowner's policy.","The loss settlement amount isthe funds that aninsurance company pays out to the homeowner in the event of a homeowner's insurance claim.In the case of homeowner's insurance, homeownersare typically required to carry insurance that will cover at least 80 percentof the replacement value of their house. may be less than the amount of full coverage if the 80 percentcoinsurance requirement is not met.Every homeowner'sinsurance policy contains a loss-settlement provision that details how aclaim will be paid. This provision applies to the replacement cost payment for both the dwelling and the personal property. It mayallowthe insurance company to delay full payment of the claim by paying only the actual-cash-value of the loss and, in some instances, forego full payment altogether because the insured does not have sufficient funds to repair or replace."
692,Losses Incurred,"Losses incurred refers to benefits paid to policyholders during the current year, plus changes to loss reserves from the previous year. Losses incurred represents profit that an insurance company will not make from its underwriting activities, since funds are being paid to policyholders based on the coverage outlined in their insurance contracts. This statisticis typically viewed by calendar year.","The amount of losses incurred may vary from year to year. For example, a flood last year may have resulted in an increased number of homeowner policy claims, but no flood this year means that incurred losses are lower. Insurance companies set aside a reserve to cover liabilities from claims made on policies that they underwrite. The reserves are based on a forecast of the losses an insurer may face over a period of time, meaning that the reserves could be adequate or may fall short of covering its liabilities. Estimating the amount of reserves requires actuarial projections based upon the types of policies underwritten."
693,Losses and Loss-Adjustment Expense,Losses and loss-adjustment expense is the portion of an insurance companys reserves set aside for unpaid losses and the costs of investigation and adjustmentfor losses. Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses aretreated as a liabilities. This figure also includes estimates for losses for insurance ceded to reinsurers.,"Insurance companies set aside a reserve to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses.It's like an insurance companys rainy day fund. The reserves are based on an estimate of the losses an insurer may face over a period of time, meaning that the reserves could be adequate or may fall short of covering its liabilities. Estimating the amount of reserves requires actuarial projections based upon the types of policies underwritten.Insurers have several goals when processing a claim: ensure that they comply with the contract benefits outlined in the policies that they underwrite, limit the prevalence and impact of fraudulent claimsand make a profit from the premiums they receive."
694,Lost Policy Release (LPR),A lost policy release (LPR) is astatement releasing an insurance company from its liabilities. A lostpolicy releaseis signed by the insured party and signifies that the policy in question has been lost or destroyedor is being retained.,"Historically, an insured party that wanted to cancel an insurance policy would have to produce the original insurance documents that were created when the policy was underwritten. If the policy was lost or misplaced, the insured would have to demonstrate that the policy is still being canceled, and this was done with a lost policy release. The lost policy release is used to signify that the policyholder is intentionally canceling the policy."
695,Macro Risk,Macro risk is a typeof political risk in which political actions in a host country can adversely affect all foreign operations. Macro risk can come about from events that may or may not be in the reigning government's control.,"As an example of macro risk, any company thatengagesin foreign direct investment in a country that is on the verge of switching to an anti-foreigner slanted government would be facing tremendous macro risk, because the government is likely to expropriate any and all foreign operations, regardless of industry.There are many organizations that provide reports and information on the degree of political risk that a country may possess. Furthermore, companies have the opportunity to purchase political risk insurance from a variety of organizations in order to mitigate potential losses."
696,Malpractice Insurance,"Malpractice insurance is a type of of professional liability insurance purchased by health care professionals (and sometimes by other types of professionals, such as lawyers). This insurance coverage protects health care providers against patients who sue them under the claim that they were harmed by the physician's negligent or intentionally harmful treatment decisions.","A study by the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Medicine concluded that most medical doctors will need malpractice insurance sometime during their professional career – and for good reason. Medical negligence is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and it can happen during diagnosis, during treatment or as part of advice given for treatment after an illness. Between 80,000 and 100,000 deaths in the US every year are caused by diagnosis errors, and 195,000 patients die in hospitals each year due to preventable mistakes."
697,Manifestation Trigger,The manifestation trigger activates insurance coverage under the policy in place when the personal injury or property damage becomes known by the property owner or victim.,"The manifestation trigger is an important concept in insurance because it sets the date of incident discovery as the date for coverage, not when the incident may have actually occurred. For example, if a winter storm knocks a tree on a homeowners house while the homeowner is on vacation, the triggering date for the policy is when the homeowner first detects and reports the accident, not the date the tree hit the house."
698,Manual Excess,"In insurance, manual excess refers to the premium charged for carrying insurance coverage above the liability limit of the policy. Manual excess rates are determined based on the risk factors associated with the coverage, such as the type of liability being covered and the estimated severity and frequency of losses.",Manual excess insurance is a form of temporary excess limit insurance – not unlike overdraft protection on a bank checking account.
699,Maritime Law,"Maritime law, also known as admiralty law, is a body of laws, conventions, and treaties that govern private maritime business and other nautical matters, such as shipping or offenses occurring on open water. International rules, governing the use of the oceans and seas, are known as the Law of the Sea.","In most developed nations, the maritime law follows a separate code and is an independent jurisdiction from national laws. The United Nations (UN), through the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has issued numerous conventions that can be enforced by the navies and coast guards of countries that have signed the treaty outlining these rules. Maritime law governs many of the insurance claims relating to ships and cargo; civil matters between shipowners, seamen, and passengers; and piracy."
700,Market Value Clause,A market value clause is an insurance policy clause assigning the market rate value to the covered property.,"Market value clauses assign a market rate value to the property rather thanbasing it on the actual or replacement cost. The dollar amount guaranteed to insured parties in the case of a loss is a fundamental element of the insurance policy. Other than market value, the value can be set at the actual cash value of the asset or its replacement cost. The calculation option used often depends on the type of policy. Typically one sees market valueclauses covering property whose value may fluctuate over time rather than fixed assets. Commodities are the assets most frequently associated with a market value clause."
701,Mass Merchandising,"Mass merchandising is a method of selling insurance policies in which an employer, association or other organization agrees to assist in the sale of insurance policies to its respective employees or members.",Mass merchandising is most commonly associated with property and casualty insurance. Its sometimes used for auto insurance as well. Insurers who use mass merchandising to sell insurance separate the experience rating from policies sold under this method from policies sold under other methods.
702,Master Certificate,"A Master Certificate is a document that formalizes a reinsurance agreement. These certificates provide details about the parties involved in the agreement, the risks that are covered, and the laws that the agreement is governed under. If the ceding insurer and reinsurer make amendments to the reinsurance agreement they may restate the master certificate to reflect the changes.","Agreements between insurers and reinsurers tend to be much less complicated than agreements between insurers and policyholders. This is because insurers and reinsurers are said to be sophisticated companies that understand the nuances of the industry and the legal requirements of each party, while policyholders are typically not experts in insurance and thus need to understand all aspects of what they are agreeing to. The details of the reinsurance agreement are found in the master certificate."
703,Maturity Guarantee,Maturity guarantee is the dollar amount of a life insurance policy or segregated fund contract that is guaranteed within a specified period.,"Maturity guarantees, also known as annuity benefits, are available at additional premium with life insurance policies or segregated funds. Segregated funds are investment products sold by life insurance companies that combine the growth potential of investment funds with insurance protection. They are individual insurance contracts that invest in one or more underlying assets, such as a mutual fund. Unlike mutual funds, segregated funds provide a guarantee to protect part of the money invested. Even if the underlying fund loses money, the contract holder is guaranteed to receive some or all of the principal investment. But they must hold the investment for a set period to benefit from the guarantee. And they pay an additional fee for this insurance protection. If the holder cashes out before the maturity date, the guarantee wont apply. They will receive the current market value of their investment, less any fees. With a workplace pension or savings plan that is administered by an insurance company, the fund options available typically are segregated funds. However, they do not carry an insurance guarantee and do not have the higher fees associated with retail segregated funds for individuals. But because they are insurance contracts, they do carry the potential for creditor protection and the avoidance of probate fees if a beneficiary is named."
704,Maximum Foreseeable Loss,"The largest financial hit a policyholder could experience when insured property is harmed or destroyed by an adverse event such as a fire. Maximum foreseeable loss assumes a malfunction and nonresponse of the usual safeguards, like sprinklers and professional firefighters, that would normally limit such a loss.","A claim for a maximum foreseeable loss will include not just physical losses, but also business interruption while the damage is being repaired, which could take months. The business interruption might be complete (100%) or partial (say, 50%) depending on whether its possible to resume business at another location in the meantime. Basically, the maximum foreseeable loss is the worst-case scenario."
705,Medicaid,"Medicaid is a health care program that assists low-income families or individuals in paying for doctor visits, hospital stays,long-term medical,custodial care costs and more. Medicaid is a joint program, funded primarily by the federal government and run at the state level, where coverage may vary. Medicaid is available only to individuals and families who meet specified criteria. Recipients must be legal permanent residents or citizens of the United States, and may include low-income adults, their dependentsand people with specified disabilities.","Medicaid is a government-sponsored insurance program for individuals of any age whose resources and income are insufficient to cover healthcare. In the United States, it is the largest source of funding for health-related services for low-income people. Funded jointly by state and federal governments, but mainly by the latter, Medicaid is managed at the state level. The program was authorized by the Title XIX of the Social SecurityAct, which also created Medicare. The bill was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson."
706,Medical Cost Ratio - MCR,The medical cost ratio is a comparison of a health insurance company's healthcare related costs to its revenues. The medical cost ratio is one of several indicators of an insurer's financial standing.,"The medical cost ratio should be 85 percent or less in order to indicate financial health for larger employer plans and 80 percent for smaller employer and individual plans. This indicates thatthe health insurer is spending 85 percent of its earnings paying out on health care costs, and putting 15 percent towards non-medical costs such as profits, overhead expenses and reinvesting into the company for larger plans. For smaller and individual plans, the ratio should be 80 percent and 20 percent."
707,Medical Expenses,"Medical expenses are any costs incurred in the prevention or treatment of injury or disease. Medical expenses include health and dental insurance premiums, doctor and hospital visits, co-pays, prescription and over-the-counter drugs, glasses and contacts, crutches and wheelchairs, to name a few. Medical expenses that are not reimbursed are deductible within certain limits (see below).","Taxpayers with access to group health insurance coverage are seldom able to deduct medical expenses that are not reimbursed on their taxes. Only those who itemize their deductions are eligible to claim any medical expenses on the Schedule A. Furthermore, only those expenses that exceed 7.5 percentof the taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI)can be deducted."
708,Medical Patent,A medical patent is a legal protection against market competition that a government grants to the inventor of a unique medical item or process.,"A medical patent, like other types of patents, prevents competitors from making, using or selling the patented item or process for a limited time. In the United States, the three categories of patents are utility patents, design patents and plant patents. Utility patents apply to machines, processes and manufactured objects as well as to useful improvements on these items. Design patents protect ornamentation. A 1980 Supreme Court ruling made it possible to patent living, man-made organisms, a key to the success of biotechnology firms. The United States Patent and Trademark Office grants patents in the United States, and these patents are valid for 20 years."
709,Medical Payments Coverage,"Medical payments coverage is a feature of an auto insurancepolicythat covers expenses related to vehicular accidents. Medical payments coverage, also called medical expense coverage, can apply to the insured individual and any passengers in the insured vehicle, the insured individual if riding as a passenger in another vehicle and the insured individual if injured by a vehicle as a pedestrian.","Medical payments coverage can cover a variety of expenses relating to injuries stemming from an automobile accident. It covers visits to a doctor or a hospital, surgery, ambulance fees, rehabilitation and nursing care and some medical equipment. The coverage can help cover expenses regardless of which driver is considered at fault for the accident."
710,Medical Savings Account (MSA),"Medical Savings Accounts (MSA) are the predecessors of Health Savings Accounts(HSA) and have similar deductibles, tax treatment,and may act as a retirement account.","First created by several states in the early 1990s, by 1996, these plans became a Federal pilot program within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA).MSAsrequired annual Congress reauthorization and ended in 2003.

711,Medical Underwriting,"Medical underwriting is theprocess of assessing the risk associated with providing health insurance coverage. Medical underwriting involves an examination and analysis of an individuals medical information, which is used to determine how risky an individual is and, thus, how much that individual should pay for insurance. In some cases, the use of medical underwriting is restricted by law.","During the medical underwriting process, insurance companies want to understand as much as possible about a potential policyholder before actually underwriting the insurance policy. The insurer will examine the medical history, demographics, lifestyleand other factors that relate to the individuals medical needs, and, through actuarial analysis, make an estimate of the risk associated with providing medical or health insurance coverage. If an individual is considered a high-risk prospect, the insurer may decline to offer coverage, may charge a higher insurance premium, or they may set exclusions or limits to the amount of coverage offered through the policy."
712,Medicare Advantage,"Medicare Advantage plans, also referred to as Part C plans, are part of the Medicare program for senior citizens and disabled adults who qualify. Private companies provide Medicare Advantage plans instead of the federal government, and these plans typically include the same Part A hospital, Part B medical coverage and Part D drug coverage that Medicare does, with the exception of hospice care. As of 2017, about one third of the 57 million Medicare participants were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.",Medicare Advantage is a type of Medicare health plan offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare. Medicare pays the premiums for participants in Medicare Advantage plans.
713,Medicare And Medicaid Fraud,Medicare and Medicaid fraud refer to illegal practices aimed at getting unfairly high payouts from government-funded healthcare programs.,"Medicare and Medicaid fraud can be committed by medical professionals or healthcare facilities, patients or program participants, and outside parties who may pretend to be one of these parties."
714,Medicare Part D,"Medicare Part D is a prescription drug benefit program that was created through the U.S. Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. This law is sometimes also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA.","The program gives Medicare recipients these basic choices: stay in traditional Medicare without signing up for the prescription drug benefit outlined in the Act, stay in traditional Medicare and enroll in a Medicare drug plan, enroll in other Medicare plans, or enroll in a comprehensive private health plan, which may or may not cover prescription costs. The program began providing coverage for users on January 1, 2006."
715,Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI),"Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) describes a range of health insurance sold by private insurance companies to complement Medicare policies. Also known as Medigap, this type of insurance covers the cost of health care services that lie outside the scope of Medicare Part A and Part B insurance plans.",Medicare supplemental health insurance (SIM) covers common gaps in Medicares standard insurance plans. People who apply for Medigap coverage must take part in both Medicares partA coverage andpartB coverage. SIM plans supplement but does not replaceprimary Medicare coverage.
716,Medigap,"Also called Medicare Supplement Insurance, Medigap is health insurance coverage provided by private companies designed to cover excess costs not covered by original Medicare.",
717,Member Month,The member month refers to the number of individuals participating in an insurance plan each month. Member month is calculated by taking the number of individuals enrolled in a plan and multiplying that sum by the number of months in the policy.,"Member month statisticsare most commonly found in the reports of group insurance companies, such as group health plans.Determining how many individuals are enrolled in an insurance plan requires dividing the total number of member months by the number of months in the year. Thus, if an insurer indicates that its member months total 1500 then the total number of individuals covered is around 125 (1,500 member months / 12 twelve months). This is an approximation because some members may have policies that last a year, while others may have policies that last a shorter duration. For example, 1,500 member months could mean 125 members on annual policies, or it could mean 100 members on twelve-month policies and 50 members on six-month policies ([100 x 12 months] + [50 x 6 months] = 1,500 member months)."
718,Mercantile Safe Burglary,"Mercantile safe burglary insurance refers to coverage for money, securities and other assets that are stolen from a safe, vault or other locked container. Actually, it is an outdated form of insurance coverage that was purchased by businesses who used safes, and was included in commercial property insurance policies.","Mercantile safe burglary insurance hearkens back to an era, before the rise of credit cards and electronic payments, when businesses conducted most of their transactions in cash (or with paper checks). This cash, along with other valuables that the business wanted to protect, was stored in a safe (or some sort of locked chest or cabinet) overnight for protection. Safes presented a target of opportunity for burglars who would use tools, explosives and other means to open them. Because the loss of cash and valuables could severely damage a business ability to stay open, obviously, merchants and shopkeepers would purchase mercantile safe burglary insurance."
719,Microinsurance,"Microinsurance productsoffer coverage to low-income households orto individuals who have little savings and is tailored specifically for lower valued assets and compensation for illness, injury or death.","As a division of microfinance, microinsurance looks to aid poor families by offering insurance plans tailored to their needs. Microinsurance is often found in developing countries, where the current insurance markets are inefficient or non-existent. Because the coverage value is lower than a usual insurance plan, the insured people pay considerably smaller premiums."
720,Minimum Essential Coverage,"Minimum essential coverage is the type of health insurance policy an individual needs to meet health coverage requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), U.S. health reform. Individuals who do not maintain minimum essential coverage may have to pay a penalty of 2.5% of yearly household income or a maximum of$695 per adult, $347.50 per child under 18, to$2,085 per household.",You are considered to have minimum essential coverage and wont have to pay the penalty if you have:
721,Minority IPO,"A minority IPO is an initial public offering in which a parent company spins off one of its subsidiaries or divisions, but retains a majority stake in the company after issuance. This means that after the public offering, the parent company will still have a controlling stake of the new public company. Shareholders who purchase shares during the IPO will only be minority owners of the company, hence the name minority IPO. A minority IPO is also called a partial IPO.","A minority IPO allows a parent company to guide a subsidiary through the initial public offering process while regaining enough to control to protect a vulnerable company from takeover or bad management decisions by retaining majority control of the subsidiary. The parent company may retain this majority stake forever or may slowly dissolve its ownership over time, depending on the parent companys goals for the subsidiary."
722,Mirror Fund,"An insurance provider will create a mirror fund to replicate the performance of a high-quality mutual fund. These mirror funds come as the investment options for a variable life insurance policy. The method allows policyholders to invest in mutual funds without the requirement of investing directly in the market. Also, the policyholder may avoid the minimumacceptable investment by accessing the fund through the insurance company's mirror fund. ","A mirror fund most often will accompany variable universal life insurance (VUL) products.Variable life insurance is a permanent lifepolicy which has aseparate investment account. The investment account may include a menu of various investment instruments, such as stocks, bonds, equity funds, and money market funds. The tax-deferredperformance from the investment account will add or deduct from the death benefit.Premiums paid willcover administrative fees and themanagement of the investment account.Policyholders mustundergofull medical underwriting."
723,Mobile Health,Mobile health refers to the emerging field of mobile technologies that can help patients and doctors communicate or provide medical information directly to a patient without the involvement of a doctor.,"Mobile health is a segment of the medical technologies market that puts the computing power of mobile technologies, particularly smartphones, to use in delivering medical information. Digital medical applications, or apps, have shown potential in a wide range of situations, but the benefits of these technologies tend to focus on improved quality and efficiency in delivery of tailored healthcare services to patients. The field of mobile health is sometimes referred to as mHealth."
724,Modified Endowment Contract - MEC,A modified endowment contract (MEC) is a tax qualification of a life insurance policy whose cumulative premiums exceed federal tax law limits. The taxation structure and IRS policy classification changes after becoming a modified endowment policy.,"The taxation of withdrawals under the MEC is similar to the that of non-qualified annuity withdrawals. For withdrawals before the age of 59 1/2, a premature withdrawal penalty of 10% may apply. As with traditional life insurance policies, MEC death benefits are not subject to taxation. Modified endowment contracts are usually purchased by individuals who are interested in tax-sheltered, investment-rich policies, and do not intend to make pre-death policy withdrawals."
725,Modified Payoff,A modified payoff is a partial insurance reimbursement that is paid to depositors of failed banks. Customers who have lost money in excess of what is covered by FDIC insurance can expect to receive a modified payoff. The payoff is based on an FDIC estimate of what they could collect from liquidation.,The FDIC instituted the modified payoff in the early 1980s. It was offered in response to a rash of bank failures that led to substantial customer losses.
726,Molecular Biology,Molecular biology is the study of interaction among the macromolecules that form an organism's basic genetic profile.,"Molecular Biology focuses on the interrelationships between molecular entities in the human cell. It draws upon elements of chemistry, and other areas of biology, especially genetics and biochemistry. The most common subjects of molecular biology are large, complex molecules known as macromolecules. Nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates are prominent examples of this group. Nucleic acids and proteins, in particular, are central to the study of molecular biology and the genetics of the human cell."
727,Monoline Insurance Company,"A monoline insurance company is an insurance company that provides guarantees to issuers, often in the form of credit wraps, that enhance the credit of the issuer. These insurance companies first began providing wraps for municipal bond issues, but now provide credit enhancement for other types of bonds, such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.","Issuers will often go to monoline insurance companies to either boost the rating of one of their debt issues orensure that a debt issue does not become downgraded. The ratings of debt issues that are securitized by credit wraps often reflect the wrap provider's credit rating.Along with providing credit wraps, monoline insurance companies also provide bonds that protect against default in transactions that deal with physical goods."
728,Monopolistic State Fund,A monopolistic state fund is a government owned and operated fund that is set up to provide insurance coveragein specified states and territories. Employers must purchase these coverages from the state fund and no private parties may compete for the business.,"A monopolistic state fund is simply a fund on which the state has a monopoly. The most common type of these funds is workers compensation insurance. In addition to monopolistic state funds, there are monopolistic states. These are states that do not allow private-sector companies to oversee competing funds, and include North Dakota, Ohio, Washington and Wyoming. Additionally, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands fall into this group."
729,Mortality And Expense Risk Charge,A mortality and expense risk charge is avariable annuity fee included in certain annuity or insurance products that compensates the insurance company for mortality risks and othervarious risks and expenses it assumes under the annuity contract.,"A mortality and expense risk charge is calculated any time an insurance company offers an annuity to a client. To do so,it must make assumptions about uncertain factors (such as the life expectancy of the annuitant) and the likelihood of uncertain events actually occurring. Itmust also provide the annuitant with peace of mind via lifetime payout options for the future and fixed insurance premiums. The insurance company prices these risks inherent to the structure of an annuity as accurately as possible and packages it into a dollar value charge for the annuitant."
730,Mortality Table,"A mortality table shows the rate of deaths occurring in a defined population during a selected time intervalor survival from birth to any given age. Statistics included in amortality table show the probability a person's death before their next birthday, based on their age. Mortality tablesarealso known as a ""life tables,""""actuarial tables"" or""morbidity tables.""","Mortality tables are mathematically complex grids of numbers that show the probability of death for members of a givenpopulation within a defined period of time. Mortality tables are usually constructed separately for men and for women. Other characteristics can also be included to distinguish different risks, such as smoking status, occupation and socio-economic class. There are even actuarial tables that determine longevity in relation to weight."
731,Multiline Insurance,Multiline insurance can refer to complex insurance instruments which a company will use to bundle the risk exposures of multiple corporate insurance obligations into one insurance contract. The term also comes to refer to an insurance agency that writes policies for several different lines of insurance products. These various products will include coverage for a variety of risk categories. ,"Individual customers may decide to bundle their coverage for auto, marine, and homeowners into amultiline contract. Commercial clients may bundleseveral different, but equally necessary, business policies into a single multiline contract. Bundling should reducethe overall premium and make it easier for year-end accounting. At the same time, the liability limits can increase, much like it would under an umbrella policy."
732,Mutual Insurance Company,"A mutualinsurance companyis owned by policyholders. The sole purpose of a mutual insurance company is to provide insurance coverage for its members and policyholders, and its members are given the right to select management. Federal law, rather than state law, determines whether an insurer can be classified as a mutual insurance company.",
733,Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund,A federal fund that insures mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund supports both FHA mortgages used to buy homes and home equity conversion mortgages (the most common type of reverse mortgage) used by seniors to extract equity from their homes.,"Mortgagors (borrowers) of either loan type pay into the fund with a one-time up-front premium – which may be paid at closing or rolled into the loan – and annual mortgage insurance premiums of a certain percentage of the loan amount. The cost of mortgage insurance depends on the loan type and occasionally changes, depending on the mortgage market and the viability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund."
734,Named Perils Insurance Policy,"A named perils insurance policy is a home insurance (or business) insurancepolicy that only provides coverage on losses incurred to your property from hazards or events named on the policy. Named peril policies may be purchased as a less expensive alternative to a comprehensive coverage or broad policies, which are policies that tend to offer coverage to most perils.","If a homeowner doesn't live in an earthquake and flooding prone area, theymay elect to get a named perils insurance policy and only declare coverage against fire, theft and hail, while leaving the earthquake and flooding coverage off the policy."
735,National Association Of Insurance And Financial Advisors - NAIFA,"The National Association Of Insurance And Financial Advisors - NAIFAA is a nonprofit group that works on behalf of its members to promote a favorable regulative environment, provide professional education services and ensure ethical professional conduct for insurance and financial advisors.","The Falls Church, Va.-based NAIFA provides its members with sales training, networking facilities and other tools to help them succeed and build their practices. In addition, they lobby on Capitol Hill to promote favorable legislation for the insurance and financial advisory industry."
736,National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC),"The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)is a nationwide organization whose main responsibility is to protect the interests of insurance consumers. Some of the main objectives of the NAIC are to provide support to insurance regulators across the country by promoting competitive markets, the improvement of insurance regulations and equitable treatment of insurance consumers.","The NAIC was foundedin 1871 andis headquartered in Kansas City. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) wascreated and governed bychief insurance regulators from all50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Its first major missionwas the development of uniform financial reporting standards forinsurance companies. Since then, new legislative concepts, new levels of expertise in data collection and delivery, and a commitment to even greater technological capability have evolved the mission of NAIC.Through its many committees, task forces, and working groups, the NAIC attempts to develop and implement laws and regulations that create national standards in an attempt to further benefit insurance consumers."
737,National Insurance Contributions (NIC),"National Insurance Contributions are payments made by employees and employers into the United Kingdom's National Insurance (NI). National Insurance contributions initially funded programs for the ill and unemployed, and later on eventually paid for state pensions, too. Contributions fall into categories which can either count toward an individual's eligibility for benefits or are paid without counting towards any type of entitlement depending on the category it falls under.","National insurance contributions are made through payroll and income taxes. Over the years, contributions expanded to cover other government-provided benefits. Limits on contributions were removed from upper income levels, making this a more redistributive program."
738,National Organization Of Life And Health Insurance Guaranty Associations - NOLHGA,"National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA) is a voluntary organization of U.S. life and health insurance guaranty associations. Founded in 1983, it covers policyholders when a multistate life or health insurance company fails.","National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA) serves as a complementary or alternative resource to state guaranty associations. The state associations provide coverage, up to the limits established by law, to residents with policies from insurers licensed to do business in that state. NOLHGA steps in to support and assist policyholders impacted by the insolvency of a multi-state life or health insurance company."
739,Net Amount at Risk,"Net amount at risk is the monetary difference between the death benefit paid by a permanent life insurance policy and the accrued cash value. For example, if a policy's death benefit is $200,000 and its accrued cash value is $75,000, then the amount at risk equals $125,000. The amount at risk determines the cost of protection provided by the policy.","In general, the cash value in a permanent policy is designed to grow, and this growth reduces the net amount at risk in a policy, which keeps the mortality cost at reasonable levels even though theactualcost per $1,000 of death benefit is growing every year.As an example of this concept in action, consider a whole life insurance policy issued for a face value of $100,000. At the time of issue, the entire $100,000 is at risk, but as cash value accumulates, it functions as a reserve account, which reduces the net amount at risk for the insurance company. Therefore, if the cash value of the insurance policy rises to $60,000 by its 30th year in force, the net amount at risk is then $40,000."
740,Net Collections,Net collections is aterm used in medical accounting to describe the amount of money collected on the agreed-upon fees charged. Net collections are usually lower than net charges (the total amount the provider agrees to accept as payment) and it is certainly lower than gross charges (the providers total invoice amounts before insurance adjustments and other adjustments).,"The net collections rate is calculated by dividing payments received from insurers and patients by payments agreed-upon with insurers and patients. A medical practice reports its net collections on the income statement along with gross charges, net charges and the gross collection rate."
741,Net Interest Cost (NIC),"Net interest cost (NIC) is a mathematical formula that an issuer of bonds uses to compute the overall interest expense that is associated with their bonds, which they will have to pay. The formula for net interest cost (NIC) is based on the average coupon rate weighted to years of maturityand is adjusted for any associated discounts or premiums.","Net interest costis one methodthat companies use to compare bids from underwriter syndicates.When a company issues a bond, they usually sell the bonds to asyndicateof underwriters, who, in turn, sell the bonds to the public. Thus, companies will try to getthe best price from underwriters –they want underwritersthat producethe least amount of interest costs over the life of theloan. But it's not the only way. NIC takes into account anypremiumordiscountapplicable to the issue, as well as the dollar amount ofcouponinterestpayable over the life of the issue.Because NIC doesn't incorporate thetime valueofmoney, other tactics can be used to obtainactionableinformation about the quality of anunderwriter's bid.When a debt issueruses the NIC to evaluate their underwriter bids, they'll usuallycontract with thesyndicate offering the lowest net interest.However, this may not be the best method forselecting underwriters who may havea low NIC, but have a higher TIC (total interest cost) over the lifetime of the bond."
742,Net Leverage (Insurance),"Net leverage is the sum of an insurance companys net premiums written ratio and its net liability ratio. Net leverage is used to determine how exposed an insurer is to pricing and estimation errors.Net leverage is calculated as (net premiums written / policyholders surplus) + (net liabilities / policyholders surplus). The net leverage ratio shows how exposed the insurer is to errors in estimation, with a high value indicating that a company is more reliant on having adequate reserve funds.","An insurance company balances two goals: investing the premiums it receives from underwriting activities so as to return a profit, and limiting its risk exposure created by the policies that it underwrites. Insurers may cede premiums to reinsurance companies in order to move some of the risks off of their books.Net leverage is a type of leverage ratio. Unlike gross leverage, net leverage does not include ceded reinsurance leverage."
743,Net Liabilities To Policyholders' Surplus,"Net Liabilities To Policyholders' Surplus is the ratio of an insurers liabilities, including unpaid claims, reserve estimation errors, and unearned premiums, to its policyholders surplus. Also called the net liability leverage ratio, represents the risk that an insurers loss reserves wont cover its claims, requiring it to dip into policyholders surplus. The ratio is usually expressed as a percentage.","Insurance companies set aside a reserve to cover liabilities that arise from claims made on policies that they underwrite. The reserves are based on an estimate of the losses an insurer may face over a period of time, meaning that the reserves could be adequate or may fall short of covering its liabilities. Estimating the amount of reserves requires actuarial projections based upon the types of policies underwritten."
744,Net Line,A net line is the amount of risk that an insurance company retains after subtracting any risk ceded to reinsurers.,A net line represents the amount of loss to which an insurer using reinsurance is potentially exposed.
745,Net Premium,Net premium is the expected present value of a policys benefits less the expected present value of future premiums. The net premium calculation does not take into account future expenses associated with maintaining the policy.,"The net premium value of a policy differs from the policys gross premium value, which takes into account future expenses. The calculated difference between net premium and gross premium equals the expected present value of expense loadings, less the expected present value of future expenses. Thus, a policys gross value will be less than its net value when the value of future expenses is less than the present value of those expense loadings."
746,Net Premiums Written,"Net premiums written is the sum of premiums written by an insurance company over the course of a period of time, less premiums ceded to reinsurance companies, plus any reinsurance assumed. Net premiums written represents how much of the premiums the company gets to keep for assuming risk.",Looking at changes to net premiums written fromyear to year is one way to gauge the health of an insurance company.
747,Net Premiums Written To Policyholder Surplus,Net premiums written to policyholder surplus is a ratio of an insurance companys gross premiums written less reinsurance ceded to its policyholders surplus. Net premiums written to policyholder surplus is a measurement of how many losses the insurer can absorb from claims.,"Insurers have several goals when processing a claim: ensure that they comply with the contract benefits outlined in the policies that they underwrite, limit the prevalence and impact of fraudulent claims, and make a profit from the premiums they receive. Insurers must maintain a high enough reserve in order to meet projected liabilities, but if the loss reserves are not high enough the insurer will have to dip into its surplus. If the insurer goes through its loss reserves and policyholders surplus it will be close to insolvency."
748,New Drug,A new drug is a medication or therapy that has not been used before in clinical practice to treat a disease or condition. A new drug that is marketed in the U.S. must first obtain approval from the Food and Drug Administration.,"A new drug may be an innovative new compound that is classified as a new molecular entity by the FDA, or it may be related to a previously approved product. Getting FDA approval for a drug is a multi-step process that takes years and millions of dollars."
749,New Indications,"New indications is a term thatmedical companies and professionals use to signify that a procedure or drug has been recognized to be advisable or necessary. New indications refer to new applications of an existing prevention, diagnosis or treatment of a disease. It is a positive report provided by credible professionals through established testing techniques. The next step is usually clinical trials before official approval by the country's regulatory association.","New indications are often used in news releases on medical treatments and pharmaceutical companies when referring to their drugs or the equipment involved. For example, on April 16, 2018, the FDA released a new indication approval for the drug Opdivo (nivolumab), for the treatment of advanced melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, advanced renal cell carcinoma, MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, urothelial carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Contrast this to its first approval in December 2014, which was limited to treatment for patients with advanced melanoma that could not be removable with surgery or that no longer responded to other drugs."
750,No-Load Life Insurance,No-load life insurance is a type of life insurance that charges much lower fees and expenses than conventional life policies. This is due primarily to the absence of a commission for the selling agent. No-load life insurance mirrors traditional life insurance in all other aspects.,"No-load life insurance policies allow cash value to accumulate faster inside the policy because of their lower cost. However, although its lower cost allows no-load life insurance to provide an affordable alternative to lower-income life insurance policyholders, carriers of no-load policies should be examined for financial stability. No-load policiestypically offer very little in the way of customer service."
751,Non-Assessable Policy,A non-assessable policy is a type of insurance policy that cannot require the policyholder to pay additional funds to cover an insurers losses if the losses are greater than the insurers reserves. These policies are the most commonly found commercial line insurance policies offered.,"Non-assessable policies are the type of insurance policy that most people are familiar with. They are associated with commercial line insurance, such as auto policies and homeowners insurance. Most insurance policies are considered non-assessable policies, with the insurance company offering them owned by stockholders rather than by policyholders (as in the case of a mutual insurance company)."
752,Non-Contestability Clause,A non-contestability clause is a provision in a person's will that threatens to redistribute inheritance if beneficiaries contest the will.,"Non-contestabilityclauses in wills intend to keep order during the settlement of an estate by punishing heirs who attempt to contest clauses in wills. The effectiveness of these measures can be limited, as courts typically will allow beneficiaries to contest wills despite the presence of a non-contestability clause. Wills are part of the probate process and therefore subject to state law. Some states, in turn, refuse to enforce non-contestability clauses. In those states, a court decides whether the party contesting the will has a legal case. If they do not, these states require the courts to proceed with the will's instructions without redistributionsgoverned by non-contestability clauses."
753,Non-Scheduled Personal Property,"Non-scheduled personal property refers to the items automatically covered by homeowners insurance without the need for an appraisal or receipt, usually including common items that most people own.","Non-scheduled personal property tends to cover items not valued highly enough to warrant separate insurance. For example, under home insurance or renters insurance, clothes, jewelry, common sports equipment, kitchen appliances, cameras and other small electronics typically qualify as non-scheduled personal property."
754,Nonadmitted Balance,A nonadmitted balance is anitem on an insurers balance sheet that represents reinsured liabilities for which the reinsurer has not provided collateral. Nonadmitted balance entries reduce the policyholders surplus because they represent a liability.,"Insurance companies cede risk to reinsurers in order to reduce their exposure to the risks associated with the policies that they underwrite. In exchange for taking on some of the insurers risk the reinsurer is provided a fee, often a portion of the premium. The reinsurer is thus responsible for claims made up to a certain level, and is required to demonstrate that it will be able to handle those claims if losses do arise."
755,Noncancellable Insurance Policy,"A noncancellable insurance policy is a life or disability insurance policy that an insurance company cant cancel, increase the premiums on or reduce the benefits of as long as the customer pays the premiums. Noncancellable insurance policies give the policyholder peace of mind that the cost, amount of coverage and term are known and that theywont have to re-qualify for the policy at some point in the future when theirhealth might not be as good and insurance might be harder to get.","When applying for life or disability insurance, it is advisable totry to obtain a policy that is both noncancellable and guaranteed renewable.If you buy a policy that is only guaranteed renewable, the insurer must let you keep your policy as long as you pay your premiums, but your premiums could go up. The insurer is allowed to raise the premiums on a guaranteed renewable policy as long as the increase affects numerous policyholders and not just a particular customer."
756,Nonforfeiture Clause,"A nonforfeiture clause is an insurance clause stipulating that an insured party can receive full or partial benefits or a partial refund of premiums after a lapse due to non-payment. Standard life insurance and long-term care insurance may have nonforfeiture clauses. The clause may involve returning some portion of the total premiums paid, the cash surrender value of the policy, or a reduced benefit based upon premiumspaid beforethe policy lapsed.","When the owner of whole-life insurance policy opts to surrender thepolicy, nonforfeiture options become available. The insurance company guarantees a minimum cash value for the insurancepolicy after a specific period, typically three years, from when placed in force."
757,Nonstandard Auto Insurance,"Nonstandard auto insurance is offered to drivers considered to carry the most risk. Nonstandard auto insurance for a driver takes into account the drivers characteristics, and is offered to drivers considered the most likely to file a benefits claim. These drivers pay the highest premiums for coverage.","Insurers typically divide auto insuranceinto three categories: preferred, standard, and nonstandard auto insurance.Being able to estimate the risk in underwriting a new policy can make or break an insurance company. If the company prices the policy correctly and understands the claim risk, it can be profitable, since the premiums it brings in will exceed the benefits it pays out. They want a mix of low premium drivers who carry low risk, and drivers paying a higher premium who are more likely to get into an accident. If the insurer does not effectively understand the risk associated with underwriting a policy, it can wind up taking on too much risk and paying out more benefits than the premiums it receives."
758,Normal Loss Expectancy,"Normal loss expectancy is the amount of loss an insurance company expects to incur during standard conditions. Normal loss expectancy represents the amount of loss an insurer may face if, despite all risk mitigation systems and processes working correctly, damages still occur.","When an insurance company underwrites a new insurance policy, it agrees to cover the policyholder against a specific peril in exchange for a premium. The amount of premium charged has to be adequate to cover expected losses. If the established premium is too high, the potential policyholder may go to a competing insurer to obtain a lower rate. If the set premium is too low, the insurance company may find that it must dip into its capital reserves to cover losses. Rate-setting is thus a critical aspect of the underwriting process."
759,Nuclear Hazards Clause,"Nuclear hazards clause is property insurance policy language that excludes from coverage any damage caused by nuclear reactions, nuclear radiation or radioactive contamination. The nuclear hazards clause is intentionally broad to protect insurers against paying the extraordinarily large claims that could otherwise result from such events, whether they are controlled or accidental and whether the damage is direct or indirect. However, an insurance policy will still cover losses from certain otherwise covered events, such as fires or theft, even if those events are caused by a nuclear event.","Insurance companies began excluding nuclear events from coverage in the late 1950s. Standard homeowners' insurance policies now contain a nuclear hazards clause excluding from coverage losses from nuclear events. So do commercial and farm property policies, auto insurance policies and inland marine policies, among others. The nuclear hazard clause means that if you discover that your property has radioactive contamination when you go to sell it, you cant file a claim with your homeowner's insurance. You would have to sue the entity that caused the contamination to recover your losses."
760,Obligatory Reinsurance,"Obligatory reinsurance isreinsurancein which the ceding insurer agrees to send a reinsurer all policies which fit within the guidelines of the reinsurance agreement. An obligatory reinsurance treaty, also called an automatic treaty, requires the reinsurer to accept these policies.","Obligatory reinsurance is a type of treaty reinsurance in which an insurer is required to cede and a reinsurer required to accept all risks that meet a set of predetermined conditions. This allows the insurer and reinsurer to develop a long-term relationship, as the insurer does not have to find a new reinsurer for every new risk. Each risk is automatically accepted under the terms of the arrangement, even if the insurer has yet to notify the reinsurer."
761,Occurrence Policy,"An occurrence policy covers claims made for injuries sustained during the life of an insurance policy, even if the claim is filed after the policy has been canceled. An occurrence is an event that can result in the filing of an insurance claim.","Insurance companies can provide two types of liability insurance coverage through an occurrence policy and claims made. Occurrence coverage covers incidents that happened while the policy was in effect, even if the claim was filed after the policyholder changed insurance companies later on. For example, an individual exposed to hazardous chemicals may only experience the effects years later. Occurrence coverage will cover the employer and the former employee even if the injured individual files a claim after retiring. Insurers typically place a cap on the total coverage offered through such a policy. One form of cap limits the amount of coverage offered each year but lets the coverage limit reset each year. For example, a company that purchases five years of occurrence coverage with an annual cap of $1 million will allow the policyholder to have up to $5 million in total coverage."
762,Offering,"An offering is the issue or sale of a security by a company. It is often used in reference to an initial public offering (IPO) when a company's stock is made available for purchase by the public, but it can also be used in the context of a bond issue.","Usually, a company will make an offering ofstock or bonds to the public in an attempt to raise capital to invest in expansion or growth. There are instances of companies offering stock or bonds because of liquidity issues (i.e. not enough cash to pay the bills), but investors should be wary of any offering of this type."
763,Office Of The Superintendent Of Financial Institutions - OSFI,"An independent agency responsible for the regulation of banks, insurance companies, trusts and pension plans in Canada. The Office Of The Superintendent Of Financial Institutions reports to the Minister of Finance. It was formed in 1987 when the Department of Insurance and the Office of the Inspector General of Banks were combined. ","The OSFI is designed to maintain consumer confidence in the financial markets. To accomplish this, it guarantees the deposits through the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), reviews the pension plans of businesses to ensure that they are properly funded and helps mitigate the impact of financial issues that may crop up. "
764,Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a federal agency that oversees the execution of laws relating to national banks. Specifically, it charters, regulates, and supervises national banks and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks in the U.S. The Comptroller of the Currency, appointed by the President and approved by the Senate, heads the OCC.","Founded through the National Currency Act of 1863, the OCC monitors banks to guarantee they operate safely and meet all requirements. The OCC overseesseveral areas includingcapital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk, information technology, compliance, and community reinvestment."
765,Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund,"The Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund, one of two trust funds managed by the Social Security Administration,is used to pay benefits to insured retired workers, their spouses and children, and survivors of deceased insured workers. The Social Security Administration (SSA) holds granted authority to distribute OASI Trust Fund benefits.","Daily, a proportionate amount of taxes received under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) are deposited into the OASI Trust Fund. The SSA invests these funds, held in trust, and otherresources, not required for current expenses, into interest-bearing federal securities. Earned interest is, in turn, deposited into the fund."
766,"Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Program - OASDI","The old age, survivors, and disability insurance program (OASDI) is theofficial name for Social Security in the United States. The OASDI is a comprehensive federal benefits program that provides benefits to retirees, disabled people and their survivors. The goal of the program is to partially replace income that is lost due to old age, death of a spouse or qualifying ex-spouse, or disability. Payments to qualifying persons are funded through payroll taxes collected by the government called FICA taxes.The program was ushered in through the Social Security Act, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14, 1935, when the U.S. economy was in the depths of the Great Depression.","TheOASDIprogram provides payments to people who meet certain criteria. For old age payments, money is paid to qualifying persons between the ages of 62 and 70. Payments are calculatedbased upon their wages earned while they were of working age. Survivors payments are made to surviving spouses or eligible children of deceased workers. Disability payments are made to eligible persons who are no longer able to participate in substantially gainful activity and who meet additional criteria."
767,Omnibus Clause,An omnibus clause is a clause in anautomobile liability insurance policy clause which extends coverage to individuals not named in the policy. The omnibus clause applies to individuals who are authorized to use an insured vehicle.,"An omnibus clause in an automobile insurance policy expands the number of people who can be covered, but how far this coverage extends depends on legal interpretations of how authority is granted. Once the individual named in the policy provides permission to the first non-named individual, called the first permittee, that individual may then allow another party, the second permittee, to use the vehicle. This may be the case if a parent allows his or her child to borrow the family car, and the child then allows a friend to drive the vehicle."
768,Open Cover,"Open cover is a type of marine insurance policy in which the insurer agrees to provide coverage for all cargo shipped during the policy period. Open cover insurance is most commonly purchased by companies that make frequent shipments, as the blanket coverage keeps them from having to purchase a new policy each time a shipment is made.","Open cover policies are commonly used in international trade, specifically by companiesinvolved in high volume tradeoverlong periods of time. Companies purchase this type of coverage because it eliminates the need to negotiateterms of a new policy each time a shipment is made. Since the insured is agreeing to purchase a longer-term contract, it may be able to realize lower premiumsbecause the insurer does not have to spend time on administrative activitiesand because the insurer benefits from a having a guaranteed premium over a longer period of time."
769,Opinion Of Title,The opinion of title is the legal opinion which atteststo the validity of the title deed to a parcel of property. The opinion is sometimes issued in conjunction with an insuring title agency.,"Opinions of title are usually issued by attorneys. Title companies use the opinion made by the attorney to issue a document called a title report. This is a legal document that can be used in varying ways, but is most often in the process of purchasing a property, researching ownership or verifying a lien status."
770,Orphan Drug,"Orphan drug is a drug or biological product that treats a rare condition or disease. A condition is considered rare if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 people but the drug companies do not expect to recover the costs of developing and marketing a drug to treat the condition.","An orphan drug may either be a new product or an approved product that is being used to treat a rare condition. The Orphan Drug Designation program by the Food and Drug Administration provides orphan status to drugs and biologic products such as a vaccine or blood product that are intended to treat, diagnose or prevent rare diseases or conditions."
771,Out-Of-Pocket Expenses,"Out-of-pocket expenses refer to costs that individuals pay out of their own cash reserves. The widely used phrase applies to the costs required to maintain a fixed asset, costs incurred by an insurance holder when he receives medical care, work-related and business expenses that are later reimbursed by an employer, and personal expenses in several other categories.","Common examples of out-of-pocket expenses include gasoline for a car, repairing an old building, taking a business client to lunch, and certain medical payments such as prescription costs. For example, if one purchases a car and later pays to have it repaired and filled with gas, the repairs and the gas are both out-of-pocket expenses, as they are costs above and beyond the cost of purchasing the car, which the car owner has to pay out of his personal budget. The purpose of out-of-pocket expenses varies based on the category under discussion."
772,Out-of-Pocket Limit,"The out-of-pocket limit is the maximum amount a health insurance policyholder will pay for covered healthcare over the course of a policy year. The out-of-pocket limit, also called the out-of-pocket maximum, helps the policyholder control risk by placing a cap on the most they could spend. It also helps the insurer control risk by making the policyholder responsible for a portion of his or her healthcare costs. After the policyholder meets the out-of-pocket limit, the health insurance company pays 100 percentof allowed healthcare expenses, which helps the individual avoid major financial problems associated with high healthcare costs in years when theyneeda lot of treatment.","Health insurance premiums do not count toward the out-of-pocket limit. In addition, because some types of healthcare coverage a policyholder may want to receive (such as elective surgery) might not be covered by the health insurance plan, a policyholder could still end up paying more than the out-of-pocket limit in agiven year. Balance billing charges for out-of-network services also do not count toward out-of-pocket limits."
773,Over-Line,"Over-line insurance coverage exceeds the amount typically offered by an insurer or reinsurer. Over-line coverage can occur when an insurer underwrites more policies than normal, or when a reinsurer accepts a larger amount of liabilities through a reinsurance treaty than it usually does.","Over-line coverage refers to the amount of insurance that exceeds an insurer's normal capacity. This is important because insurers primarily make money through their underwriting activities. In exchange for indemnifying a policyholder, the insurance company collects a premium, and invests this premium in a variety of different assets in order to generate a profit. Investments tend to be low risk and relatively liquid, since the insurer needs to be sure that it has access to funds if claims are made against its policies. The amount of liability that an insurer can take on is referred to as its capacity."
774,Overall Liquidity Ratio,"Overall liquidity ratio is the measurement of a companys capacity to pay for its liabilities with its assets. The overall liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing total assets by the difference between total liabilities and conditional reserves. This ratio is used in insurance company analysis, as well as in the analysis of financial institutions.","Regulators use financial metrics, like the overall liquidity ratio, to determine whether an insurer, bank, or other financial company is healthy enough to cover its liabilities. Other similar metrics include the quick liquidity and current liquidity ratios. Quick liquidity compares liabilities to assets that are readily available for use, including cash, short-term investments, government bonds, and unaffiliated investments."
775,Oversubscribed,"Oversubscribed is the term for when the demand for an IPO's shares is greater thanthe number of shares issued. When a new security issue is oversubscribed, underwriters or others offering the security can adjust the price or offer more securities to reflect the higher-than-anticipated demand.","An oversubscribed security offering often occurs when the interest for an initial public offering (IPO) of securities exceeds the total number of shares issued by the underlying company. The degree of oversubscription is shownas a multiple, such as ""ABC IPO oversubscribed two times."" A two-times multiplemeans there istwice as much demand for shares as the scheduled issue."
776,Own-Occupation Policy,"An own-occupation insurance policycovers individuals who become disabled and are unable to perform the majority of the occupational duties that they have been trained to perform. This type of insurance policy is contingent on the individual being employed at the time the disability occurs. Own-occupation insurance policies arealso known as a ""pure own-occupational policy.""","When an own-occupation policy goes into effect, the policyholderand the insurance carrier sign a contractthat says the insurance carrier will pay the policyholdera monthly benefit if they become disabled. But what actually determines a disability? The key factor in an own-occupation policy is how ""disabled"" is defined in an insurance contract.Because the definition on own-occupation is very flexible, persons covered under an own-occupation policy may find another job and still receive full benefit payments."
777,PLUS Loan,"A PLUS (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students) loan is a federal student loan available to graduate or professional students and parents of dependent undergraduate students. Typically with a PLUS Loan, also known as a Direct PLUS loan, the parent borrows money on the student's behalf. To be eligible for a PLUS Loan, a student must be enrolled at least half-time, and the parent must pass a standard credit check. Graduate and professional degree students enrolled at least half-time at an eligible school and working towards a graduate or professional degree can also apply for PLUS loans for their own academic studies.","The major benefit of a PLUS Loan is that the parent can borrow the entire amount the student needs for his/her education. This includes housing, tuition, books, and other related expenses. The maximum available is ""the cost of attendance (determined by the school) less any other financial assistance received,"" according to the Federal Student Aid website. Another notable benefit is that the borrower does not have to demonstrate a financial need to be eligible for the loan."
778,Paid-Up Additional Insurance,"Paid-up additional insurance is additional whole life insurance that a policyholder purchases, using the policys dividends.Paid-up additional insurance is available as a rider on a whole life policy. It lets the policyholder increase theirliving benefit anddeath benefit by increasing the policys cash value. Paid-up additions themselves thenearn dividends, and thevalue continues to compound indefinitelyover time. The policyholder can also surrender paid-up additions for their cash value or take a loan against them.","The cash value of paid-up additional insurancecan increase over time, and these increases are tax-deferred. Another benefit is that the policyholder can use them to increase coverage without going through medical underwriting. This is not only convenientbut alsoextra valuablefor a policyholder, whose health has declined since the policy was originally issued and whocant increase insurance coverage through other means. Even without medical underwriting, paid-up additional insurance may have a higher premium than the base policy because theprice depends on apolicyholders age at the time he or she purchases the extra insurance. Some policies, such as those issued by the Veterans Administration, have no premiums for paid-up additions."
779,Participating Policy,"A participating policy is an insurance contract that pays dividends to the policy holder. Dividends are generated from the profits of the insurance company that sold the policy and are typically paid out on an annual basis over the life of the policy. Most policies also include a final or terminal payment that is paid out when the contract matures. Some participating policies may include a guaranteed dividend amount, which is determined at the onset of the policy. A participating policy is alsoreferred to as a ""with-profits policy.""","Participating policies are typically life insurance contracts, such as a whole life participating policy. The dividend received by the policyholder can be used in several different ways. First, the policyholder can apply the dividend proceeds to the insurance policy's premium payment. Second, the dividend can be kept with the insurance as a deposit in order to generate interest much like a regularsavings account. Finally, the policyholder can simply receive the dividend payment in cash, much like a dividend payment on a stock."
780,Payable Through Draft,Payable-through-draft (PTD) is a method to issue payment via a specific bank. These instruments draw money from the account of the issuing corporation and use them to pay bills. Insurance companies frequently use payable-through-draft to pay claims.,"The face of the payable-through draft check shows the bank's name. However, the bank verifies neither the signature nor the endorsement, which is the responsibility of the issuing company. Credit union share-drafts are also payable-through-draft instruments, usually cleared by a correspondent bank. "
781,Payback Period,"The payback period is the length of time required to recover the cost of an investment. The payback period of a given investment or project is an important determinant of whether to undertake the position or project, as longer payback periods are typically not desirable for investment positions. The payback period ignores the time value of money (TVM), unlike other methods of capital budgeting such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and discounted cash flow.",Much of corporate finance is about capital budgeting. One of the most important concepts that every corporate financial analyst must learn is how to value different investments or operational projects. The analyst must find a reliable way to determine the most profitable project or investment to undertake. One way corporate financial analysts do this is with the payback period.
782,Peak Debt,Peak Debt is the point at which a household or economy's interest payments become so high compared withincome that a halt in spending must occur. This is typically followed by a period of debt reduction.,"The term ""peak debt"" is said to have been coined by Jaswant Jain, Ph.D., in 2006. Jain concluded that the debt taken on by an economy such as the U.S. economy is important to increase consumption. Debt will eventually rise to a certain exhaustion point. At this point consumption must be cut to pay the interest and debt services."
783,Period Of Indemnity,The period of indemnity is the length of time for which benefits are payable under an insurance policy. It is also used to denote the time period for which indemnity or compensation is payable under a business interruption policy. The period of indemnity is usually the most critical component of quantifying the business interruption loss.,"One of the most important and helpful endorsements to a business interruption policy is the extended period of indemnity endorsement. If the business interruption coverage is being written under more recently issued forms, an automatic 30-day extended period of indemnity is built into the coverage. But absent one of these forms, this endorsement must be added to the policy to extend the indemnity period."
784,Permanent Life Insurance,"Permanent life insurance is an umbrella term for life insurance plans that do not expire, unlike term life insurance, which promises payment of a specified death benefit within a specific period of years.","Typically, permanent life insurance combines a death benefit with a savings portion, allowing policies to build a cash value, against which the policy owner can borrow funds or, in some instances, withdraw cash to help meet needs such as paying for a child's college education or covering medical expenses."
785,Personal Injury Protection - PIP,"Personal injury protection, also known as no-fault insurance, is a feature of automobile insurance that covers the health care expenses associated with treating injuries sustained in a car accident.","Personal injury protection coversmedical expenses for policyholders and theirpassengers who are hurt in auto accidents covered, even if some dont have health insurance. If the cost of necessary medical care exceeds the auto insurance policys personal injury protection limits, health insurance sometimes covers further expenses.Policies have a per-person maximum, meaning that coverage limited to a certain amount per person if numerous people are injured in an accident."
786,Personal Lines Insurance,Personal lines insurance includes property and casualty insurance products that protect individuals from losses they couldnt afford to cover on their own.These types ofinsurance linesmakeit possible to do things like drive a car and own a home without risking financial ruin. Personal lines insurance and commercial lines insurance each make up about half of the property and casualtyinsurance market.,"Personal lines insurance includes products such as homeowners insurance, flood insurance, earthquake insurance, renters insurance, automobile insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, umbrella insurance and health insurance. These insurance products protect individuals and families against potentially crushing financial losses caused by fire, theft, natural disasters, death, accidents, lawsuits and illness."
787,Pet Insurance,"A policy purchased by the owner of a pet that will lessen the overall costs if expensive medical bills are incurred by that pet. This is similar to health insurance policies except that it relates specifically to pets and will cover, either fully or in part, the often expensive fees that are incurred during veterinary procedures. Pet insurance started in the U.S. in 1980, and was the first policy was sold in 1982 for television's Lassie. ","Many animal medical procedures, such as surgeries and sickness, are very expensive to treat. To help with these costs, a pet owner can buy a policy that will save out-of-pocket expenses by paying a yearly or monthly fee known as the premium. The cost and coverage changes with which policy you get and for what type of animal you're insuring. For instance, it costs more for an outdoor cat than an indoor, and premiums are higher for the percentage of coverage you wish to buy. "
788,Pharmacology,"Pharmacology is the study of how drugs affect people. More formally, pharmacology is the study of both the helpful and detrimental effects of natural and synthetic chemicals on biological systems. Pharmacology helps us understand how to treat and prevent diseases and how the chemicals we use in our daily lives or in our jobs might harm us.","Pharmacology is based on biology and chemistry and has been formally studied since the 1860s. The two major branches of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics which examines how drugs affect the body, and pharmacokinetics which is how the body processes drugs. An emerging branch of pharmacology called pharmacogenetics studies how drugs interact with an individuals unique genetic makeup. The science of pharmacology is essential to making sure drugs are absorbed by the body and transported to the right places so they help patients."
789,Pharmacovigilance,"Pharmacovigilance refers to the scientific process of monitoring, evaluating and preventing adverse side effects in drugs and medical therapies. Researchers and medical professionals identify a drugs negative effects and weigh these risks against the benefits of the medication.",Pharmacovigilance (PV) is intended to safeguard patients against unintended consequences of medications by systematically constructing a knowledge base available to stakeholders across the scientific and medical communities.
790,Phase 1,"Phase 1 is the initial introduction of an experimental drug or therapy to humans. This phase is the first step in the clinical research process involved in testing new or experimental drugs. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, a division of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, oversees these clinical trials.","Phase 1 clinical studies or clinical trials are focused on the safety aspect of the new drug, rather than its efficacy in treating a disease. Phase 1 trials typically involve 20 to 100 people, a combination of healthy volunteers and patients or people with the condition. If the new drug is intended to treat a form of cancer, the research will involve patients with that type of cancer."
791,Phase 2,"Phase 2 is the second phase of clinical trials or studies for an experimental new drug, in which the focus of the drug is on its effectiveness. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, a division of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, oversees these clinical trials.","Phase 2 trials typically involve hundreds of patients who have the disease or condition that the drug candidate seeks to treat. The main objective of Phase 2 trials is to obtain data on whether the drug actually works in treating a disease or indication, which is generally achieved through controlled trials that are closely monitored, while safety and side-effects also continue to be studied."
792,Phase 3,"Phase 3 is the final phase of clinical trials for an experimental new drug, embarked upon if Phase 2 trials show evidence of effectiveness. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, a division of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversees these clinical trials.",
793,Phase 4,"Phase 4 refers to the final of four stages of new drug testing. This phase takes place after the drug has been introduced to the marketplace. Phase 4 testing and reporting builds upon the clinical testing done prior to the drugs release, but it provides more robust data due to a larger sample size.","Phase 4 research, sometimes referred to as post-marketing surveillance (PMS), takes advantage of larger data sets, more naturalized settings and observational rather than interventional methodologies to provide a real-world complement to the research conducted in the three earlier stages of the testing process. Phase 1 focuses on establishing the safety of a drug for human consumption. Phase 2 examines the efficacy of the drug. Large-scale clinical trials take place in Phase 3, which can take years to compile the data necessary for regulatory approval. Phase 4 expands on that clinical testing to examine the effects, adverse and beneficial, of a drug over an extended period of time and among a larger sample of patients."
794,Phenotype,"Phenotype refers to the set of outward, observable appearances and characteristics of an individual organism. When used to describe a human, this set would include body weight, hair length or behavioral qualities such as anxiety.","Phenotype refers to a collection of qualities displayed by an individual. Note that phenotype differs markedly from genotype, which is the complete set of inherited qualities carried by an individual. Genotype contributes to phenotype, but the two are not interchangeable.The qualities that contribute to phenotype come from a combination of inherited genetic attributes and environmental or external factors. In colloquial terms, the genetic factors are sometimes referred to as nature, while the externalities are commonly known as nurture. In scientific terminology, the former is also known as the genotype."
795,Piggyback Registration,A piggyback registration occurs when an underwriterpermits existing company shares to be sold in conjunction with a new public offering. The registration of these securities is said to be piggybackingoff of the initial public offering.,"In a piggyback registration, the underwriter is required to sign off on the idea to set the process in motion. In addition, the arrangement must be noted in the new issue's prospectus. Under these kinds ofarrangements, the prospectus will provide all the details needed, including the names of those selling private shares in the transaction. Piggyback registrations are often done as a means of consolidating all the outstanding sharesand allowing joint ventures to participate in the initial public offering."
796,Pink Slip Party,"A pink slip party is an event that helps recently laid off professionalsnetwork with job recruiters. Pink slip parties usually occur during times of economic upheaval, when unemployment rates are high, and businesses are closing or downsizing.",Pink slip parties are casual gatherings which will sometimes also fundraise for charity while providing job leads and advice to attendees. Another aspect of these parties is that they allow unemployed professionals to network with each other. This can result in the sharing of prospective leads as well as commiserating with other professionals that are experiencing the same career setbacks.
797,Point-of-Service Plan (POS),"A point-of-service plan (POS) is atype of managed-care health insurance plan that provides different benefits depending on whether the policyholder uses in-network or out-of-network health care providers. A POS combines the features of the two most common types of health insurance plans, the health maintenance organization (HMO) and the preferred provider organization (PPO). POS plans only represent a small share of the health insurance market; most policyholders have either HMO or PPO plans.","A point-of-service plan is like an HMO in that it requires the policyholder to choose an in-network primary care doctor and to get referrals from that doctor if they want the plan to cover a specialists services. And a point-of-service plan is like a PPO in that it still provides coverage for out-of-network services, but the policyholder will have to pay more than if they used in-network services. However, the POS plan will pay more toward an out-of-network service if it is referred by the primary care physician than if the policyholder goes outside the network without a referral. The premiums for a POS plan fall in between the lower premiums offered by an HMO and the higher premiums of a PPO."
798,Poison Pill,A poison pill is a tactic utilized by companies to prevent or discourage hostile takeovers. A company targeted for a takeover uses a poison pill strategy to make shares of the company's stock unfavorable to the acquiring firm.,The term poison pill is the common colloquial expression referring to a specially designed shareholder rights plan.
799,Policy Loan,"A policyloan is issued by an insurance company that uses the cash value of a person's life insurance policy as collateral. Sometimesthese loans are referred to as a ""life insurance loan.""Traditionally, policy loans were issued at a very low interest rate, but that is no longer universally true. If aborrower fails to repay a policyloan, the money is withdrawn from the insurance death benefit.","If someone needs access to emergency cash, getting a policy loan, which accesses the cash value of a lifeinsurance policy, is one option – if the policy ispermanent life insurance,available as either whole lifeoruniversal life.Unliketerm life insurance, which does not accumulate cash value, universal or whole life insurance has acash component, especially later on. During the early years of the policy,thepremiummostly goes to funding theindemnitybenefit, but the cash value continues toincreaseas the policy matures."
800,Policy Or Sales Illustration,"A policy or sales illustration is an educational tool that shows a prospective or new insurance policyholder how a life or disability insurance policy works. A policy or sales illustration factors in all apolicys key details, including the applicant's or insureds age, gender and underwriting class (the risk level used to determine premiums).","A policy or sales illustration also shows the insurance products name, term, benefit amount, premium, cash values (if the policy has a cash value component), and projected dividends (if the policy is being issued by a mutual insurance company). The illustration will also describe any policy riders or options. A policy illustration shows how the policys value is expected to change over time and what assumptions those values are based on. A disability policy illustration will also show the waiting period before benefits become payable and describe theconditions that must be met for the policy to pay out."
801,Policy Year Experience,Policy year experience describes the total premiums and losses associated with insurance policiesunderwritten or renewed by an insurance company within a given time period. Policy year experience is one method used by insurance companies to set losses against earned premiums.,"Insurers calculate policy year experience either for individual insurance policiesor in aggregate, meaning the total losses and premiums for an entire set of policies."
802,Policyholder Dividend Ratio,"The ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned. The policyholder dividend ratio is a measurement of the profitability of an insurance company or the overall insurance industry, and is examined alongside the operating ratio.","The policyholder dividend ratio measures the money flowing out of an insurance company in the form of dividends. Dividends are generated from the premiums generated from the insurers underwriting activities, and in the case of the dividend ratio only premiums earned are taken into account. This is because premiums that an insurer obtains through underwriting activities are treated as a liability until part of the contracts duration has elapsed. As the contract approaches its end date, more and more of the premium is considered earned."
803,Policyholder Surplus,"Policyholder surplus areassets of a policyholder-owned insurance company (also called a mutual insurance company) minus itsliabilities. Policyholder surplus is one indicator of an insurance companys financial health. It gives an insurance company another source of funds, in addition to its reserves and reinsurance, if it needs to pay a higher than expected amount of claims. When an insurance company is publicly owned, its assets minus its liabilities are instead called shareholders equity.","Policyholder surplus is one metric that insurance rating companies use when developing the simple letter ratings ranging from A++ to F. Consumers can turn to these ratings for help in choosing an insurance company that is strong financially. Its important for consumers to choose an insurer that can afford to pay its policyholders claims under varying circumstances, even if a widespread disaster like a severe storm means that thousands of policyholders are simultaneously filing claims."
804,Political Risk Insurance,"Political risk insurance provides financial protection to investors, financial institutions and businesses that face the possibility of losing money because of political events. Political risk insurance protects against the possibility that a government will take some action that causes the insured to experience a large financial loss. Political risk insurance can cover many possibilities, such as expropriation (e.g., government confiscation of property), political violence (e.g., acts of civil unrest or insurrection), the inability to convert local currency and repatriate it, sovereign debt defaultand even acts of terrorism and war.","While developing markets can present a great opportunity for business growth, they also present greater risks than developed markets. Political turbulence can cause assets to decline severely in value orbe destroyed or confiscated and lose value altogether. Without political risk insurance, businesses would be especially reluctant to operate in developing countries with above average levels of political instability that threaten their assets and their ability to operate smoothly."
805,Portfolio Entry,"A portfolio entry is an account of all liabilities a reinsurer is responsible for when entering a reinsurance treaty. A portfolio entry accounts for unearned premiums from policies that are inactive during an accounting period, as well as unearned premiums that carry over into a future accounting period.","An insurance company continuously underwrites policies over the course of the year. At any given time, it will have a portfolio of policies with different expiration dates. At the end of a reporting period, such as a fiscal year, the insurer must identify the dollar amount of premiums earnings and the remaining dollar amount of unearned premiums. Earned premiums are associated with policies that have ended, while unearned premiums, considered liabilities, represent premiums collected on active insurance policies. Active policiesare a liability for the insurance company because the policyholder could still file a claim before the expiration of the policy contract."
806,Portfolio Insurance,"Portfolio insurance is either a method of hedging a portfolio of stocks againstmarket risk by short selling stock index futures, or it can also be brokerage insurance, such as that available fromthe Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).","Portfolio insurance is ahedging techniquefrequently used by institutional investors whenmarket direction is uncertain or volatile. Short selling index futures can offset any downturns, but it also hinders any gains. This hedging technique is a favorite ofinstitutional investorswhen market conditions are uncertain or abnormally volatile."
807,Portfolio Reinsurance,"Portfolio reinsurance is a type ofcontract in which an insurer has a large block of insurance policies reinsured.Portfolioreinsurance, also known as assumption reinsurance, may involve shifting risk from the insurer to thereinsurerfor a particular type of policy (such aslife insurance), all policies within a geographic area, or for a book of business.","Portfolio reinsurance, like all forms of reinsurance, is a way for insurance companies to mitigate risk and in some cases lower their taxes. It always involves an insurance company buying insurance on policies they have already written. The company buying the reinsurance is called the ceding company or the cedent. Insurance companies balance the risk that they take on whenunderwritingpolicies with thepremiumsthat those policies bring in. The more risk that the insurer takes on, the greater its chance forinsolvency, especially if the policies it underwrites are for a narrow set of insurance types or in a small geographic area. Insurers transfer some of this risk to a reinsurer through the purchase of a reinsurance policy, with the reinsurer accepting some or all of the policy risk in exchange for a fee."
808,Pre-Disability Earnings,"Pre-Disability Earnings is the amount of qualifying income that a disability insurance policyholder was earning before an injury. Pre-disability earnings are used to calculate how much disability income a policyholder will qualify for in the case of an injury. The injury may prevent the policyholder from working at all, or may prevent the policyholder from working full time.","Individuals buy disability income insurance in order to receive some level of income in the case of an injury. Without disability income insurance a worker may rely on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), or may not have any source of income at all. This can be disastrous to families, especially if the person injured was the sole income earner in the family."
809,Pre-Existing Condition,"A pre-existing condition is any personal illness or health condition that was known and existed prior to the writing and signing of an insurance contract. Health or life insurance policies will often identify a customer's pre-existing conditions before writing an insurance contract for that person, and will typically not cover pre-existing conditions until a specified period of time has elapsed. In some cases, pre-existing conditions may not be covered at all.","Insurance companies typically do not wish to provide insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, i.e.medical circumstances that are already known to exist."
810,Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion Period,"Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion Period is a health insurance benefit provision that places limits on benefits or excludes benefits for a period of time due to a medical condition that the policyholder had prior to enrolling in a health plan. Pre-existing condition exclusion periods are regulated policy features, meaning that the insurer is likely to have an upper limit on the periodof time the exclusion period will last.","A pre-existing condition exclusion period limits the amount of benefits that an insurer has to provide for specific medical conditions, and does not apply to medical benefits afforded by a health insurance policy for other types of care. For example, a policyholder may be excluded from receiving benefits for a pre-existing heart condition for a period ofmonths after starting a policy, but may still receive care for non-preexisting conditions, such as the flu."
811,Preferred Auto Coverage,"Preferred auto insurance is offered to drivers considered to fall into the lowest risk profile. This takes into account the drivers characteristics, and is offered to drivers considered the least likely to file a benefits claim. These drivers pay the lowest premiums for coverage.","Being able to estimate the risk in underwriting a new policy can make or break an insurance company. If the company prices the policy correctly and understands the claim risk it can be profitable, since the premiums it brings in will exceed the benefits it pays out. Most insurance companies want a mix of low premium drivers who carry reduced risk, and higher premium drivers who are considered more likely to get into an accident. If the insurer does not effectively understand the risk associated with underwriting a policy it can wind up taking on too much risk and paying out more benefits than it receives in the premiums."
812,Preferred Provider Organization (PPO),A preferred provider organization (PPO) is a medical care arrangement in which medical professionals and facilities provide services to subscribed clients at reduced rates. PPO medical and healthcare providers are called preferred providers.,Most health insurance plans are serviced through either apreferred provider organization (PPO) or a health management organization (HMO). PPO participants are free to utilize the services of any provider within their network. Out-of-network care is available but will result in higher costs to the insured.
813,Premium Balance,"Premium balance is the amount of premium that is owed to an insurer for a policy, but which has not yet been paid by the policyholder. The premium balance will decrease in value over the course of the policy term as the policyholder makes installment payments. Policyholders may sometimes request a refund of any unearned premium.","Many insurers allow policyholders to pay for their policies in installments. Paying the full value of a policys premium can be a challenge on your budgetto do all at once, and offering different payment structures allows insurers to reach a broader market. This type of policy feature is most often seen in auto insurance, which may offer monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual installments."
814,Premium Income,Premium income can refer to the proceeds that an investor earns from writing an options contract or the revenue that an insurance carrier earns from policyholders periodic premium payments.,"Premium income is any money received by an individual or business as part orall of a premium payment. The term applies most commonly to options contracts or insurance policies. In both cases, premium income compensates the recipient for the risk that they will have to deliver a financial obligation to the counterparty. In the case of an options contract, that obligation will either be cash or an underlying security. An insurance companys obligation will almost always be cash to replace lost assets."
815,Premium to Surplus Ratio,Premium to surplus ratio isnet premiums written divided by policyholder surplus. Policyholder surplus is the difference between an insurance companys assets and its liabilities.The premium to surplus ratio is used to measure the capacity of an insurance company to underwrite new policies.,"Analysts may look at two formats of the premium to surplus ratio: gross and net. A company with gross written premiums of $2.1 billion, net written premiums of $1.5 billion and a policyholders surplus of $900 million will have a gross premium to surplus ratio of 233% ($2.1 billion / $900 million)) and a net premium to surplus ratio of 167% ($1.5 billion / $900 million)."
816,Prepaid Insurance,"Prepaid Insurance paymentsare made in advance for insurance services or coverage. The period for which insurance is prepaid is generally one year, but may exceed a year in certain cases. Prepaid insurance that expires in a year is classified as a current asset on a corporation's balance sheet.","Unless a claim has been made, prepaid insurance is usually renewable by the policyholder shortly before the expiry date on the same terms and conditions as the original insurance contract. However, the premiums may be marginally higher to account for inflation and other operating factors."
817,Preventive Services,"Preventive services consist ofhealthcare services that includecheck-ups, patient counseling and screenings to prevent illness, disease and other health-related problems. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the U.S. health reform enacted March 23, 2010, most health plans, including those that can be purchased on the Health Insurance Marketplace, are required to cover a set of preventive services at no cost to the policyholder(meaning that you will not have to pay a copayment or coinsurance or meet your deductible to receive certain preventive services). Covered preventive services for adults, women and children are included in all health insurance plans purchased after Sept. 23, 2010.","Preventive services are intended to help people remain healthy and to detect any health-related problems early while there is a better chance of recovery. There are many methods for prevention of disease. It is recommended that adults and children aim to visit their doctor for regular check-ups, even if they feel healthy, to perform diseasescreening, identify risk factors for disease, discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle, stay up to date with immunizations and boosters, and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider.For adults, covered preventive services include:"
818,Primary Insurance Amount - PIA,Primary insurance amount or PIA is the result of a calculationused to determine the Social Security benefits amount that would be paid out to an eligible retiree at full retirement age.,The primary insurance amount cannot be determined until after calculating the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). The AIME is calculated by taking up to 35 years of the highest earnings of a beneficiaries lifeand dividing them by 12. These wages are indexed against the national average salary from two years prior. This is done to give a fair view of the history of wage growth and to estimate how benefits should increase to cover that growth over the life of the retiree.
819,Prime Underwriting Facility,"A prime underwriting facility is a type of revolving underwriting facility, typically a short-term note, in which the lenders yield is pegged to the bank prime rate.","A prime underwriting facility is most often a short-term note with a maturity of one to three years and is an example of a revolving underwriting facility (RUF), with the yield in this case tied to the prime rate."
820,"Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance (PITI)","Principal, interest, taxes, insurance (PITI) is the sum of a mortgage payment that includes the principal amount, loan interest, property tax, andhomeowner's property and private mortgage insurance premiums.",
821,Prior Acts Coverage,Prior acts coverage is an insurance policy feature that covers claims made on insurable events that occurred prior to a policys purchase. This simplifies insurance matters for holders of liability insurance who change insurance providers.,"Prior acts coverage typically gets sold in the context of liability insurance, which protects entities from suffering legal repercussions for certain activities they undertake that inadvertently cause injury or damage to others. For example, malpractice insurance may cover legal costs and damages in the event a patient sued a medical practitioner for the provision of negligent care. Since these claims can take time to adjudicate, a business could easily end up filing a claim for an action it committed a year or more earlier."
822,Priori Loss Estimates,"Priori loss estimates refertoa technique used by insurance companies to calculate loss reserves. A priori is Latin forfrom the former,and refers to the development of an estimate using past experiences.",Priori loss estimates are used to determine expected ultimate losses from exposures.
823,Private-Passenger Auto Insurance Policyholder Risk Profile,"Private-passenger auto insurance policyholder risk profile is an estimate of the risk an insurance company will take on by covering a specific automobile operator with an insurance policy. The private-passenger auto insurance policyholder risk profile allows an insurance company to estimate the likelihood that a particular driver will get into an accident, and thus result in a claim being made against a policy. Insurance companies sort policyholders into groups based on their risk profiles.","At its heart, insurance is about accounting for risk, and the private-passenger auto insurance policyholder risk profile is designed to quantify that risk. The more likely a claim is to be made, the higher the premium an insurance company is going to charge. Automobile drivers, who have a history of accidents, live in areas where claims are more likely to be madeor have other attributes associated with higher accident rates, will have to pay a higher premium in order to obtain coverage."
824,Prize Indemnity Insurance,"Prize indemnity insurance, also known as Hole-in-One insurance, is indemnification insurance for a promotion in which participants can win prizes. Prize indemnity insurance makes it possible for companies to hold promotional events with attractive prizes such as cars, vacations, or large cash payouts without taking on the substantial financial risk of having to pay for the award.","The prize indemnityinsurance policy's premium depends on the prizes value and the statistical odds that someone will win the award. Prize indemnity insurance also protects the prize winner by guaranteeing that they will receive the promised prize because the insurer has committed to paying for it. The policys coverage limit equals the insureds potential loss, meaning the value of the prize."
825,Probable Maximum Loss (PML),"Probable Maximum Loss (PML) is the maximum loss that an insurer would be expected to incur on a policy. Probable maximum loss (PML) is most often associated with insurance policies on property, such as fire insurance. The probable maximum loss represents the worst-case scenario for an insurer.","Insurance companies use a wide variety of data sets, including Probable Maximum Loss (PML),when determining the risk associated with underwriting a new insurance policy, a process which also helps set the premium. Insurers review past loss experience for similar perils, demographic and geographic risk profiles, and industry-wide information to set the premium. An insurer assumes that a portion of the policies that it underwrites will incur losses, but that the bulk of policies will not."
826,Product Recall Insurance,"Product recall insurance covers expenses associated with recalling a product from the market. Product recall insurance is typically purchased by manufacturers such as food and beverage, toy and electronics companies to cover costs such as customer notification, shipping costs and disposal costs. Coverage generally applies to the firm itself, though additional coverage can be purchased to cover the costs of third parties.","Product recall insurancereimburses policyholdersfor financial losses sustaineda product is recalled.Product recalls can be involuntary (required by a regulatory agency or the government) or voluntary (the manufacturer notices a defect that is unlikely to force an involuntary recall), and can be costly. Some product types are generally not covered under product recall insurance, such as automobiles and related products, explosives and tobacco."
827,Professional Liability Insurance,"Professional liability insuranceprotects professionals such as accountants, lawyers and physicians against negligence and other claims initiated by their clients. It is required by professionals who have expertise in a specific area because general liability insurance policies do not offer protection against claims arising out of business or professional practices such as negligence, malpractice or misrepresentation.","Depending on the profession, professional liability insurance may have different names, such as medical malpractice insurance for the medical profession, and errors & omissions insurance for real estate agents. Professional liability insurance is a specialty coverage that is not provided under homeowners' endorsements, in-home business policies or business-owners' policies. It only covers claims made during the policy period."
828,Property Insurance,"Property insurance is a policy that provides financial reimbursement to the owner or renter of a structure and its contentsin the event of damage or theft. Property insurance can include homeowners insurance, renters insurance, flood insurance and earthquake insurance. Personal property is generally covered by a homeowners or renters policy, unless it is of particularly high value, in which case it can usually be covered by purchasing an addition to the policy called a ""rider.""If there's a claim, the property insurance policy will either reimburse the policyholder for the actual value of the damageor the replacement cost to remedy the damage.","Perils typically covered by property insurance include damage caused by fire, smoke, wind, hail, weight of ice and snow, lightning, theft and more. Property insurance also provides liability coverage in case someone other than the property owner or renter is injured while on the propertyand decides to sue."
829,Prospective Reinsurance,"Prospective reinsurance is areinsurance contract in which coverage is provided for future losses on insurable events. Prospective reinsurance differs from retroactive reinsurance, which covers losses from insurable events that may have occurred in the past.","Some reinsurance contracts contain both prospective and retroactive coverage because insurance companies have to account for two distinct types of risk. The first type of risk involves future events. The insurer has to consider the probability that a future event that is covered under a policy will result in a loss being reported. For example, that a fire will result in a loss on a fire insurance policy. The second type of risk is the liability associated with insurable events that have occurred in the past, and that a claim will be filed against the company in the future. As long as an insurance policy is active, it will be subject to claims until the premium has been fully earned."
830,Protected Cell Company (PCC),"A protected cell company(PCC) is acorporate structure in which a single legal entity is comprised of a core and several cells that have separate assets and liabilities. A PCC has a similar design to a hub and spoke, with the central core organization linked to individual cells. Each cell is independent of each other and of the companys core, but the entire unit is still a single legal entity. A PPC is sometimes referred to as asegregated portfolio company.","A protected cell company operates (PCC) with two distinct groups: a single core company and an unlimited number of cells. It is governed by a single board of directors, which is responsible for the management of the PCC as a whole. Each cell is managed by a committee or similar group, with authority to the committeegranted by the PCC board of directors. A PCC files a single annual return to regulators, though business and operational plans of each cell may still require individual review and approval by regulators."
831,Provincial Parental Insurance Plan - PPIP,"A Canadian tax deduction relating to taxes that are paid or payable on regular or self-employed income. The Provincial Parental Insurance Plan (PPIP) gives maternity, paternity, parental and adoption benefits to qualified persons. This aid is to support and encourage parents staying home with their children for the first year of the child's life. ","The province of Quebec has a different plan called the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP). The plan is in place for the same reasons, but has differing rules, regulations and tax implications. "
832,Provisional Notice Of Cancellation (PNOC),"A provisional notice of cancellation is a means by which one participant in a reinsurance treaty can notify the other participants of their intention to withdraw from the treaty. This notice is used only for withdrawal from continuous reinsurance contracts, which are typically eligible for cancellation or renewal once a year.",A provisional notice of cancellation (PNOC) allows all parties to a continuous reinsurance treaty the periodic opportunity to assess the contract and either renew or withdraw from it. Most reinsurance arrangements allow for this assessment once a year. Both the reinsured entity and the reinsurer have the right to issue a PNOC. Doing so gives them a 90-day window in which they can formally cancel the contract.
833,Public Company,"A public company is a company that has issued securities through an initial public offering (IPO) and is traded on at least one stock exchange or inover-the-counter markets. Although a small percentage of shares may be initially floated to the public, becoming a public company allows the market to determine the value of the entire company through daily trading.","Public companies are publicly traded within the open market with shares being purchased by a variety of investors. Most public companies originated from private companies that, after meeting all regulatory requirements, opted to become public in an effort to raise large amounts of capital. Examples of public companies include Google Inc., F5 Networks Inc., Chevron Corporation, and Procter & Gamble Co."
834,Public Offering Price (POP),"The public offering price (POP) is the price at which new issues of stock are offered to the public by an underwriter.Because the goal of an initial public offering (IPO) is to raise money, underwriters must determine a public offering price that will be attractiveto investors. When underwriters determine the public offering price, they look at factors such as the strength of the company's financial statements, how profitable it is, public trends, growth rates and even investor confidence.","Investors and analysts sometimes use the POP price as a benchmark against which a stock's current price can be compared. If a company's share price rises significantly above its initial public offering price, the company is considered to be performing well. However, if the share price later dips below its initial public offering price, this is considered a sign that investors have lost confidence in the company's ability to create value."
835,Pure Risk,"Pure risk, also known as absolute risk, is a category of hazard in which the outcomes are aloss or no loss, and there is no opportunity for gain. Examples of pure risk situations include premature death, identity theft, and career-ending disabilities. There are products available to mitigate pure risk hazards, such as homeowners insurance, which helps protect homeowners against the destruction of their homes.","It is harmful when pure risk is presentand loss occurs. As a contrast to pure risk, the outcomes of speculative riskinclude loss, gain, or no change. There are three types of pure risk: personal, property, and liability. There are four mitigation methods available to limit potential hazards. These methods are reduction, avoidance, acceptance, and transference. The most common method of dealing with pure risk is to transfer it to an insurance company by purchasing insurance."
836,QSEHRA,"A Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA), also known as Small Business HRA, is an Affordable Care Act-compliant health coverage plan for businesses with fewer than 50 full-time-equivalent (FTE) employees. A QSEHRA allows companies to reimburse workers up to $4,950 per year for single coverage and up to $10,000 per year for family coverage, adjusted for inflation. Reimbursements may pay the premiums for health insurance purchased on the individual market and pay for qualified medical expenses. Employees must provide proof of their actual medical coststo receive reimbursement.","Employees not covered by a QSEHRA for a full year (e.g., mid-year hires) receive a prorated amount of the full-year maximum reimbursement amount. Depending on the reimbursement received, employees participating in a QSEHRA may receive a lower subsidy or no subsidy for their health insurance premiums."
837,Qualifying Event,"A qualifying event triggers changes in a policyholders insurance due to new life circumstances, such as the birth of a child, and can be made at any time during the calendar year and not solely during open enrollment periods.","A qualifying event serves as an exclusion to typical insurance contracts with durations of one year for individual policyholders. In the case of insurance offered through an employer, individuals choose the type of coverage they want during an open enrollment period. Once open enrollment is closed,the individual may no longer make changes to thetype of insurance coverage they selected unless a qualifying event occurs. In some cases, insurance companies may offer more than one open enrollment period, and certain states may have regulations requiring insurers to offer multiple open enrollment periods."
838,Quick Liquidity Ratio,"Quick liquidity ratio is thetotal amount of a companys quick assets divided by the sum of its net liabilities and its reinsurance liabilities. Quick assets are liquid assets such as cash, short-term investments, equities, and corporate and government bonds nearing maturity. The quick liquidity ratio shows the amount of liquid assets an insurance company can tap into on short notice.","Thequick liquidityratio, also known as theacid-test ratio, is a liquidity ratio that further refines the current ratio by measuring the level of the mostliquidcurrent assets available to cover current liabilities. The quick ratio is more conservative than the current ratio because it excludes inventory and other current assets, which generally are more difficult to turn into cash. A higher quick ratio means a more liquid current position."
839,Quota Share Treaty,"A quotashare treaty isapro rata reinsurance contract in which the insurer and reinsurer share premiums and losses according to a fixed percentage. Quota share reinsurance allows an insurer to retain some risk and premium, while sharing the rest with an insurer up to a predetermined maximum coverage.","When an insurance company underwrites a new policy, it is paid a premium by the policyholder, and in exchange, it agrees to indemnify the policyholder up to the coverage limit. The more policies that aninsurer underwrites, the more its liabilitieswill grow, and at some point, it will runout of capacity to underwrite any new policies. In order to free up capacity, the insurer can cede some of its liabilities to a reinsurer through a reinsurance treaty. In exchange for taking on an insurers liabilities, the reinsurer receives a portion of the policy premiums."
840,Rate On Line,"Rate on line (ROL) is the ratio of premium paid to loss recoverable in a reinsurance contract. Rate on linerepresents how much an insurer has to pay to obtain reinsurance coverage, with a higher ROL indicating that the insurer has to pay more for coverage. Rate on line is the inverse of a reinsurance contracts payback period.","Insurance companies use reinsurance in order to free up additional capacity to underwrite new policies by transferring some of their liabilities to reinsurers. In exchange for taking on some of an insurers liabilities, reinsurers receive a portion of the premium that insurers collect on the policies that they underwrite."
841,Re-Entry Term Insurance,"Re-entry term insurance is a type of life insurance contract that offers low rates for a fixed period, and which will continue to offer low rates if the policyholder passes periodic medical examinations. Re-entry term insurance first appearedduring the 1970's, in response to increased inflation and consumer demand for lower premium increases on standard term-life contracts.","Re-entry term insurance typically offers low premiums for the first several years. In many cases, the policies will not require the policyholder to take a physical examination during this period."
842,Re-Offer Price,"A re-offer price is theprice at which the underwriting syndicate of a debt issue resells the bonds or IPO securitiesto public investors. The syndicate will purchase the bonds for a specified amount from the issuing firm and re-offer the bonds or securities to the public, usually at a different price.","An underwriting investment bank may facilitate a debt issue by agreeing to purchase all of the bonds or securitiesfor a price below face value. Having the underwriters purchase the bond issue, instead of passing the sale onto the public, removes the company's risk of not selling the entire issue. The investment banker will re-offer the bonds to public investors at a higher price, which may be above (premium) slightly below (discount) par value. In a serial issue, most common to municipal general obligation bonds, the first bonds to mature are frequently at a premium with a higher coupon rate. The last bonds to mature in the offering are sometimes sold at a discount, but carry a lower coupon rate."
843,Reallowance,A reallowance is a fee paidto a securities firm which is not part of theunderwriting syndicatebringing a new offering to the market. Theunderwriting grouppays thereallowancefee.The fee provides an incentive to broker-dealer firms to sell shares of the new issue to its client base. The amount of thereallowanceis typically a percentage of the underwriting spread.,"Most often, areallowance happens when there isuncertain investor demand. The underwriting syndicate may wish to enlist an additional broker's to increase demand in the underlying shares of the new issue. The underwriting banks will set the reallowancebonus as a portion of the spreadthey receive for bringing the offering to market. The offering may be an initial public offering(IPO), debt security, or the release of additional shares of a traded company."
844,Recapture Provision,A recapture provision is a provision in a reinsurance treaty that allows the ceding partyto take back some or all of the risk initially ceded to the reinsurer. Recapture provisions outline the circumstances in which a recapture can occur.,"When an insurance company underwrites a new policy, it agrees to indemnify the policyholder in exchange for a premium. This indemnification is a liability, and the insurer is responsible for covering losses of claims filed.There are regulatory and financiallimits on the amount of risk to which an insurer can expose itself. With each new policy written, the insurer lessens its ability to assume new risks. To reduceor spread the inherent risk, an insurer may enter into areinsurance treaty. The reinsurance treatywill containrules addressing how ceding companies may recapture risk in therecapture provision."
845,Reciprocal Insurance Exchange,Reciprocal insurance exchanges are a form of insurance organization in which individuals and businesses exchange insurance contractsand spread the risks associated with those contracts amongthemselves. Policyholders of a reciprocal insurance exchange are referred to as subscribers.,"A reciprocal insurance exchange is formed by bringing together two separate entities: a reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and an attorney-in-fact (AIF). The reciprocal inter-insurance exchange is used to allow subscribers to exchange policies through the attorney-in-fact, which allows them to spread around risk. The attorney-in-fact is authorized to perform business transactions on behalf of another entity, which, in this case, is the reciprocal insurance company. The AIF runs the day-to-day operations of the reciprocaland is provided with a power of attorney status by the reciprocal. The AIF may be owned by the reciprocal, referred to as a proprietary reciprocal, or may be contracted from a third party, referred to as a non-proprietary reciprocal."
846,Reinstatement,"Reinstatement is the restoration of a person or thing to a former position. Regarding insurance, reinstatement allows a previously terminated policy to resume effective coverage. In case of nonpayment, the insurer may require evidence of eligibility, such as an updated medical examination for life insurance, and full payment of outstanding premiums.",Reinstatement of a life insurance policy occurs after the end of a grace period and when the contract is no longer in force. Reinstatement requirements may vary among life insurance providers. There is noguaranteeby law for reinstatement terms. The reinstatement process may depend on how much time passed since the policy lapse and the type of insurance policy. Sometimes applying for a new policy may be less expensive than reinstating an old policy.
847,Reinstatement Clause,"A reinstatement clause is aninsurance policy clause that states when coverage terms are reset after the insured files a claim. Reinstatement clauses typically do not reset a policys coverage limit, but they do allow the policy to restart coverage for future claims.","A reinstatement clausestates when coverage terms are reset after the insured files a claim.Individuals and businesses purchase insurance policies to cover themselves from damages or losses caused by specific perils, such as fires and floods. Coverage is triggered when the peril being insured against occurs, at which point the insured can file a claim to receive money to cover damages. The amount that the insured can recoup from the insurer is set at a maximum amount, called the coverage limit. This limit may be set on a per occurrence, per risk basis, or aggregate loss basis."
848,Reinsurance,"Reinsurance, also known as insurance for insurers or stop-loss insurance, is the practice of insurers transferring portions of risk portfolios to other parties by some form of agreement to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim. The party that diversifies its insurance portfolio is known as the ceding party. The party that accepts a portion of the potential obligation in exchange for a share of the insurance premium is known as the reinsurer.",Reinsurance allows insurers to remain solvent by recovering some or all of amounts paid to claimants. Reinsurance reduces net liability on individual risks and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. It also provides ceding companies the capacity to increase their underwriting capabilities in terms of the number and size of risks.
849,Reinsurance Assisted Placement,A reinsurance assisted placement is reinsurance business developed through the assistance of areinsurancecompany.,"Reinsurance assistedplacements have thereinsureroffer matching funds to the original sale, which may have been made by a broker or agent. The reinsurer works in this case with the insurer, who may or may not cedeits policies. In any case, the insurerworks in cooperation with the reinsurerin a reverse flow arrangement."
850,Reinsurance Ceded,"Reinsurance ceded is the portion of risk that a primary insurer passes to a reinsurer. Reinsurance ceded allows the primary insurer (the ceding company) to reduce its risk exposure to an insurance policy it has underwritten by passing that risk onto another company (the accepting company), with the accepting company receiving a premium for taking on the risk. The accepting company pays a commission to the ceding company on the reinsurance ceded, and the ceding company can recover part of any claim from the accepting company.","Being able to cede a portion of its risk allows an insurance company to manage its overall risk exposure. Reinsurance can be written by a specialist reinsurance company, such as Lloyds of London or Swiss Re, by another insurance company, or by an in-house reinsurance department. Some reinsurance can be handled internally, such as with automobile insurance, by diversifying the types of clients that are taken on. In other cases, such as liability insurance for a large international business, specialty reinsurers may be used because diversification is not possible."
851,Reinsurance Credit,Reinsurance Credit is an accounting entry made by an insurer for premiums ceded to reinsurers and losses recovered from reinsurers. Reinsurance credit procedures allow an insurance company to treat money owed by reinsurers for covered losses as assets.,"When an insurance company enters into a reinsurance contract, it is agreeing to shift some of the risk from the policies that it has underwritten to the reinsurer, and in turn will provide the reinsurer with a portion of the premium that it earns on those policies. Using reinsurance allows an insurer to underwrite more policies because its overall risk profile is reduced, but also opens up the insurer to reinsurance credit risk. This is the risk associated with the reinsurer becoming insolvent, and thus becoming unable to fulfill its portion of the reinsurance agreement. If the reinsurer is unable to cover the claims that it is contractually obligated to, the insurance company may find itself with a much larger liability than anticipated."
852,Reinsurance Recoverables,"Reinsurance recoverables are the portion of an insurance companys losses from claims that can be recovered from reinsurance companies. Reinsurance recoverables includes the amount owed to the insurer by the reinsurer for claims and claims-related expenses, the amount owed for estimated losses that have occurred and been reported, the amount of incurred but not reported (IBNR) lossesand the amount of unearned premiums paid to the reinsurer.","Insurance companies primarily make money from their underwriting activities. When an insurer underwrites a new policy, it collects premiums from policyholders, but it also takes on the liability associated with providing the coverage. Insurance regulators require insurers to set aside reserves in order to cover potential claims made against the policies that the insurer underwrites. The insurer will find its underwriting activities limited by how much risk it can handle. One way an insurer can reduce its risk exposure is by sharing some of this risk with reinsurance companies. Essentially, the insurer is purchasing insurance to cover a risk."
853,Reinsurance Recoverables to Policyholder Surplus,Reinsurance recoverables to policyholder surplus is the amount of incurred losses covered by reinsurers compared to policyholders surplus.,Reinsurance recoverables to policyholder surplus is used to determine how dependent an insurer is on reinsurers for policy protection. This also helps evaluate the risk that the insurer has to account for when it comes to adjustments in reinsurance.
854,Reinsurance Sidecar,A reinsurance sidecar is a financial entity that solicits private investment in a quota share treatywith an insurance company. In the quota treatythe ceding company and reinsurer share premiums and losses according to a fixed percentage.Investors who take part in reinsurance sidecars share in premiums and losses from the underwritten policies. Profits and losses will be in proportion to the amount invested.,"Typically, existing reinsurers will create sidecars as they try to spread the risk among third-party investors such as hedge funds and equity firms. "
855,Reinsurance Ticket,"A reinsurance ticket is a notification made by an insurer that discloses the different reinsurance contracts that have been affected by claims, as well as other information affecting the terms of a reinsurance contract. Reinsurance tickets are included in the claims clause of the reinsurance contract.","Most policyholders don't deal with reinsurance tickets; they reflect insurance companies' business-to-business dealings. Reinsurance contracts provide instructions when it comes to how ceding insurers and reinsurers are to share information with each other. The most important aspect of information-sharing relates to claims notifications, as the ceding insurers need to provide information about claims that have been filed – and losses that may be incurred – against policies that the reinsurer is responsible for. In order to keep track of which reinsurance contracts have been impacted on a particular day, an insurer will attach a reinsurance ticket to its daily report. Originally, this notation was in the form of a separate piece of paper literally attached to the insurer's report that listed the details, which led to the""reinsurance ticket"" nomenclature."
856,Reinsurer,"A reinsurer is a company that provides financial protection to insurance companies. Reinsurers handle risks that are too large for insurance companies to handle on their own and make it possible for insurers to obtain more business (that is, underwrite more policies) than they would otherwise be able to. Reinsurers also make it possible for primary insurers to keep less capital on hand to cover potential losses.","A primary insurer, which is the insurance company from whichan individual or business purchases a policy, transfers risk to a reinsurer through a process called cession. Just as insurance policyholders pay premiums to insurance companies, insurance companies pay premiums to reinsurers. The premiums primary insurers pay to reinsurers may be reduced by any commission the reinsurer pays to the insurer. The price of reinsurance, like the price of insurance, depends on the amount of risk. Reinsurers often have the wordRe in their names (e.g., Allianz Re, Cologne Re, Swiss Re)."
857,Renewable Term,"A renewable term is aclause in a term insurance contract that allows the beneficiary to extend the coverage term for a set period of time without having to requalify for coverage. A renewable term is contingent on premium payments being up to date, as well as a renewal premium being paid by the beneficiary.","In the context of a life insurance contract, a renewable term clause would be beneficial, as future health circumstances are unpredictable. Although the initial premiums are likely to be higher than those of a life insurance contract without a renewable term clause (the insurance company must be compensated for this increase in risk),this type of insurance is usuallyin the beneficiary's best interest."
858,Rent Guarantee Insurance,A risk-management product that protects landlords against loss if a renter defaults. This insurance is bought by thetenant and pays the monthly rent for a set period of time if the covered tenant stops making rent payments.,"Much like private mortgage insurance (PMI), rent guarantee insurance protects the landlord – not the tenant –but the tenant pays the premium. If the tenant stops paying rent, the insurance carrier, acting as guarantor,covers the rent for the period of time specified in the contract. This type of insurance has existed in the United Kingdom for some time, but is now being sold in the U.S."
859,Renter's Insurance,"Renter's insurance isproperty insurance that provides coverage for a policyholder's belongings,liabilitiesand possibly living expenses in case of a loss event.Renter's insurance is available to persons renting or subletting a single family home, apartment, duplex, condo, studio, loft or townhome. The policy protects against losses to the tenant's personal property within the rented property. In addition, a renter's insurance policy protects against losses resulting from liability claims, such as injuries occurring on the premises that are not due to a structural problem with the property (in this case, the owner's - not renter's - policy would apply).","Increasingly, proof of renter's insurance is required by many landlords. Personal belongings within a rented property are typically not covered under the owner's or landlord's property insurance. For example, if a flood or fire destroys all the personal property within a rented apartment, the structure would be covered under the landlord's policy, but the personal property would only be covered through a renter's insurance policy. Without this coverage, the tenant would be responsible for the loss out-of-pocket."
860,Replacement Property,"Replacement property is any property that is received in place of property that has been destroyed, lost or stolen. Replacement property can be personal or business property and can include real estate, equipment or even vehicles. Replacement property is often insured by a casualty-insurance carrier.","Replacement property can exceed the value of the property that was lost if the fair market value of the property has increased since it was insured against. When this happens, the taxpayer may experience a taxable responsibility on the difference between the increased value of the replacement property and the adjusted value of the property that was lost. Some exceptions to this exist to providea deferral of the tax burden ifcertain conditions are met. The perceived gain can also be excluded when the difference applies to a taxpayers primary residence."
861,Reported But Not Settled (RBNS),"Losses that have been reported to an insurance company, but that have not been settled by the end of the accounting period. Reported but not settled (RBNS) losses are calculated using an estimation of the severity of the loss based off of the available information from the claims settlement process.","Calculating reported but not settled lossesrequires an understanding of where claims are in the settlement process. The calculation is an estimate based offinformationan insurer has at hand, including information from court documents. The precision of the calculation depends on the type of loss being settled, with more complex claims being more difficult to estimate."
862,Reproduction Cost,Reproduction cost refers to the costs involved with identically reproducing an asset or property with the same materials and specifications as an insured property based on current prices. Insurers use reproduction cost as a method of valuation to calculate the costs involved with the risk of replacing an insured asset with an identical one at the same location.,"Reproduction cost looks at the cost of creating an exact replica, and should not be confused with replacement cost, which looks at the cost of replacing an insured property with one of similar functionality."
863,Reservation Of Rights Letter,"A reservation of rights letter is provided to the insured party indicating that a claim may not be covered under the policy. Reservations of rights letters do not deny a claim; instead, the letter indicates that the insurer is investigating the claim and reserves the right to deny the claim after it completes its investigation.","Insurers that issue a reservation of rights letter may ultimately deny a claim, or they may decide to defend the insured against a claim made against it. In order to get a better understanding of what happened, the insurer must conduct its own investigation. Thenotice that it intends on conducting an investigation is the reservation of rights letter. These letters are required becausewhen an insurer receives a claims notice, it containsonly a small amount of information as to what happened, what caused the damages, and who was responsible."
864,Resident Relative,"Resident relative refers to spouses and other relatives with whom an insured party shares a residence. Resident relatives are given a special status in the language of insurance policies, and in some cases are automatically included as an insured party. This coverage applies even if the resident relative is not a named insured. Homeowner, property, casualty, auto, and personal liability policies often contain language outlining who qualifies as a resident relative.","Resident relatives include individuals, typically immediate family members, who share a residence with a policyholder. Generally speaking, anyone who lives in the home and is related to the insured will likely be covered as part of the insurance unless they are for some reason excluded from the policy."
865,Residual Benefit,A residual benefit is provided by a disability insurance that provides the policyholder with part of the total benefits outlined in the policy. The residual benefit is typically calculated as a percentage of the total disability benefit.,Residual disability policies pay benefits according to the amount of income you have lost because of your disability. These policies pay benefits even if you can work part-time and are not totally disabled. The benefit is based on the percentage of income you earn working part-time in relation to what you used to earn when working full-time. Most companies require a loss of income of at least 20 percent compared to your pre-disability income in order to qualify for residual disability benefits.
866,Respite Care,"Respite care involves short term or temporary care of the sick or disabled for a few hours or weeks, designed to provide reliefto the regular caregiver. The regular caregiver is usually a family member. A family member may be hesitant to seek or use respite care to leave a loved one in the care of another; however, there is evidence that caregivers who take a break from the associated stresses can help prevent incidents of neglect or abuse.","Respite care typically comes into play with patients who are disabled, developmentally disabled, terminally ill or elderly. People who need round-the-clock care and supervision often need long-term, constant care. Respite care gives family members a break from the stressful task of nearly constant care of a loved one. Caregivers provide temporary relief when a full-time caregiver travels, tries to ease an elderly family member into an assisted living situation or simply needs a break. Respite caregivers provide meals, medication management, housekeeping, personal hygiene care and laundry service, among other services, for those who need regular care. Some respite care providers might take patients for outings and to activities away from the residence."
867,Retrospectively Rated Insurance,"Retrospectively rated insurance is an insurance policy with a premium that adjusts according to the losses experienced by the insured company, rather than according to an industry-wide loss experience. Retrospective rating combines actual losses with graded expenses to produce a premium that more accurately reflects the current experience of the insured. An initial premium is charged and adjustments are performed periodically, after the policy has expired.","Retrospectively rated insurance serves as an incentive to the insured company to control its losses, since the price of the policy is likely to decrease if the insured is able to limit risk exposure. The premium can be adjusted within a certain range of values, andthe policy premium is subject to a minimum and a maximum."
868,Return On Policyholder Surplus,"Return On Policyholder Surplus is the ratio of an insurance companys net income to its policyholder surplus. This is calculated by dividing an insurance companys after-tax income and gains by its policyholder surplus, with the policyholder surplus standing in for the insurance companys assets. It is similar to the return on equity measurement used in other industries, and is a measurement of an insurance companys financial strength. It is usually expressed as a percentage.","The return on policyholder surplus shows how much profit an insurance company can bring in relative to the amount of revenue it generates from underwriting insurance policies and investing proceeds, with policyholder surplus representing how much an insurers assets exceed its liabilities."
869,Reverse Greenshoe Option,A reverse greenshoe option is a provision contained in an public offering underwriting agreement that gives the underwriter the right to sell the issuer shares at a later date. It is used to support the share pricein the event that after the IPO the demand for the stock falls.,"The underwriter would purchase shares for the depressed price in the market, and sell them to the issuer at a higher price by exercising the option. This activity of buying a large amount of shares in the open market is intended to stabilize the price of the stock."
870,Revocable Beneficiary,"A revocable beneficiary does not have guaranteed rights to receivecompensation from an entity such as an insurance policy or atrust fund. Thepolicy owner reserves the right to make changes towho receives payment, change the terms of the policy, or terminate the policy without the need of revocable beneficiary consent. Most life insurance policies have this feature.","It is standard to designate children and spouses as beneficiaries, but the policyholder maychoose whomever they would like. The policyholder may also name their estate, a trust account, or a charity as the revocable beneficiary."
871,Rider,"A rider is a provision of an insurance policy that adds to or amends the coverage or terms. Most riders add coverages for an additional cost. However, some restrict coverages for named conditions.Standard policies usually leave little room for modification or customization beyond choosing deductibles and coverage amounts.","Riders help policyholders create insurance products that meet their specific needs. For example, in the event of a terminal illness, an accelerated death benefit rider on a life insurance policy would provide the insured with a cash benefit while living. The insured may use these funds in a discretionary manner, such as to increase their quality of life or to pay medical, final, and living expenses. When the insured passes away, the designated beneficiaries receive a reduced death benefit, the face value less the portion used under the accelerated death benefit rider."
872,Risk Financing,"Risk financing is thedetermination of how an organization will pay for loss events in the most effective and least costly way possible. Risk financing involves the identification of risks, determining how to finance the riskand monitoring the effectiveness of the financing technique that is chosen.","Risk financing is designed to help a business align its desire to take on new risks in order to grow, with its ability to pay for those risks. Businesses must weigh the potential costs of theiractions andwhether the action will help the business reach its objectives. The business will examine its priorities in order to determine whether it is taking on the appropriate amount of risk in order to reach its objectives, whether it is taking the right types of risks, and whether the costs of these risks are being accounted for financially."
873,Risk Retention Group (RRG),"A risk retention group (RRG) is astate-chartered insurance company that insures commercial businesses and government entities against liability risks. Risk retention groups were created by the federal Liability Risk Retention Act, a federal law created in 1986. A member of a risk retention group must be a business.","Risk retention groups are treated differently from traditional insurance companies. They are exempted from having to obtain a state license in every state in which they operate, and also are exempted from state laws that regulate insurance. For example, a risk retention group is exempt from having to contribute to state guaranty funds, which can lower premium costs but can also increase the possibility that policy holders will not have access to state funds in the event of group failure. All policies issued by a risk retention group arefederally required to includea warning indicating that the policy is not regulated the same as regular policies."
874,Risk-Based Deposit Insurance,"Risk-based deposit insurance isinsurance with premiumsthat reflect how prudently banks act when investing their customers' deposits. The idea is that flat-rate deposit insurance shelters banks from their true level of risk-taking and encourages poor decision-making and moral hazard. Although not all bank failures are the result of moral hazard, risk-based deposit insurance is thought to prevent bank failures. Banks that have a higher risk exposure pay higher insurance premiums.",Risk-based deposit insurance became standard after The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Improvement Act of 1991passed in the aftermath of the Savings and Loan Crisis. It required the FDIC to switch from a flat-rate deposit insurance program by 1994.
875,Runoff Insurance,"Runoff insurance is an insurance policy provision that covers claims made against companies that have been acquired, merged or have ceased operations.Runoff insurance, also known as closeout insurance, is purchased by the company being acquired and indemnifies the acquiring company from lawsuits against the directors and officers of the acquired company.",
876,S&P Claims Paying Ability Rating,The S&P claims paying ability ratingsignifies the likelihood an insurance company can pay claims to its customers. This rating from S&P Global Ratings tells existing and prospective policyholders how financially strong an insurer is.,Health maintenance organizations (HMO) and similar health plans also receive S&P claims-paying ability ratings.
877,SEC Form N-6,"SEC Form N-6 is a form that certain trust accounts must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a regulatory agency created to help prevent fraud and other forms of deception involving stocks, the SEC monitors the activities and recordkeeping of companies that trade public stock in the United States.",SEC Form N-6 is a document that must be submitted by separate accounts which are unit investment trusts that offer variable life insurance contracts. The purpose of this form is to provide investors with information that can help them decide whether to invest in a variable life insurance contract.
878,Savings Association Insurance Fund - SAIF,Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) was a government insurance fund for savings and loans and thrift institutions in the United States to protect depositors from losses due to institutional failure.,"SAIF was created in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s, during which poor real estate investments led to the failure of more than 1,000 of America's savings and loan institutions, costing taxpayers more than $160 billion."
879,Schedule F,"A section in an annual insurance statement in which reinsurance transactions are disclosed. Schedule F is used by regulators to identify the different reinsurance arrangements that an insurer may be taking part in, and provides an indicator of whether the insurer will be able to collect reinsurance recoverables if losses are incurred.","Insurance companies are required to disclose their financials to state regulators on an annual basis. This information is fed into the National Associated of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Financial Data Repository, which is a database used by the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) and other organizations to evaluate the financial ratios of insurers. Regulators use these ratios to evaluate the financial health of the insurer, and to determine whether the insurer is increasing its liabilities and thus its risk of insolvency."
880,Scheduled Personal Property,"Scheduled personal property is a supplemental insurance policy which extendscoveragebeyond the standard protection provided in a homeowners'insurance policy. By purchasing a scheduled personal property policy, owners can ensure the full-value coverage of expensive items, in the event of a claim. ","Scheduled personal property goes beyondcoverage offered instandard homeowner's policies. Standard policies do not cover all types of property and set limitations on the value amount the insurance company will pay for specific losses. Examples of possessions which may have limited coverage include fine artwork, antiques, jewels, furs, and gold coins or bars. Policyholders wishing to guard these and other items should purchase additional coverage with a scheduled personal property policy."
881,Second Event Cover,A second event cover is a term used in the insurance industry that refers to a clause in a reinsurance treaty regarding multiple occurrences of the same peril. ,"A second event cover is most commonly found in catastrophe insurance. The second event cover, as a clause, reduces the amount of loss a ceding insurer will retain on subsequent occurrences of a peril during a given period of time. In the insurance industry, an insurance company can pass off part or all of the risks associated with an insurance policy portfolio to a reinsurance firm. Passing off risk in this manner allows the ceding company to hedge against undesired exposure to loss and frees up capital to use in writing new insurance contracts."
882,Second Event Retention,"Second event retention is astrategyused to keep a ceding insurerin an excess of loss reinsurance treaty, in which payoutlevels are reduced after each subsequent occurrence. Second event retention, also known as drop down, works under the assumption that the ceding insurer will be less able to retain losses on its own as the number of claims increases. Second event rentention ismost commonly used in catastrophe reinsurance.","When insurance companies underwrite a new policy, they are creating a liability equal to the coverage limit stated in the contract. In exchange for indemnifying the insured for up to the coverage limit, the insurer receives a premium. The more policies that the insurer creates, the more risk that the insurer is exposed to. In order to reduce this risk, the insurer can enter into a reinsurance agreement with a reinsurance company. The reinsurer agrees to take on some of the insurers risk in exchange for some of the policy premiums."
883,Second Surplus,"Second surplus describes a reinsurance treaty that provides coverage above that of a first surplus reinsurance treaty. Insurers enter into surplus reinsurance treaties in order to transfer some of their own risk, or liability to another party.","By ceding some of their own risk to a reinsurer, the insurance company helps ensure itsown solvency because it carriesless risk of having to make large payouts to policyholders. These surplus treaties typically have enough capacity to cover multiple lines, but in some cases they cannot cover the entire amount needed by the ceding company. In this event, the ceding insurer either has to cover the remaining amount itself or enter into a second reinsurance treaty."
884,Second-To-Die Insurance,"Second-to-die insurance is a type of life insurance on two people (usually married) that provides benefits to the beneficiariesonly after the lastsurviving person on the policy dies. This differs from regular life insurance in that the surviving partner doesn't receive any benefits after thespouse dies. Thus, second-to-die insurance is used for estate planning.","Parents who take out this type of insurance are usuallythinking of their children. For example, a second-to-die insurance policycould be designed to pay estate taxes or support any surviving children. It is also called ""dual-life insurance"" and ""survivorship insurance""."
885,Secondary Buyout,"In a secondary buyout,a financial sponsor or private equity firm sells its investment in a company to another financial sponsor or private equity firm, thereby ending its involvement with the company. Historically, secondary buyouts have beenperceived as""panic"" sales and, thus,sometimes hard to consummate. Secondary buyouts are not the same as secondary market purchases, or ""secondaries,"" which typically involve the acquisition of entire portfolios of assets.","Part of the reason that sellerprivate equity firms seek outsecondary buyout opportunities is the instant liquidity it offers – similar to an IPObut perhapssmaller in scope.Secondary buyouts often make sense when the selling firm has already realized significant gains from theinvestment, or when the buyerprivate equity firm can offergreater benefits to the firm being bought and sold."
886,Secondary Offering,"A secondary offering is the sale of new or closely held shares by a company that has already made an initial public offering (IPO). There are two types of secondary offerings. Anon-dilutivesecondary offering isa sale of securitiesin which one or more major stockholders in a company sell all or a large portion of their holdings. The proceeds fromthis sale are paid to the stockholders that sell their shares.Meanwhile, a dilutive secondary offering involves creating new sharesand offering themfor public sale.","There are severalmajor differences between non-dilutive secondary offeringsanddilutive secondary offerings. Dilutive secondary offeringsare also known as ""follow-on offerings"" or""subsequent offerings."""
887,Section 7702,Section 7702 of the United States Internal Revenue Code defines what the federal government considers to be life insurance contracts and how they're taxed. Section 7702 imposes limitations on premiums and benefits relative to death benefitsand defines what is considered life insurance for federal tax purposes. It applies to life insurance contracts issued after 1985.,"Prior to the writing of Section 7702, federal tax law took a fairly hands-off approach when it came to the taxation of life insurance policies. Death benefits paid to life insurance beneficiaries were free of income tax, distributions were taxed on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis and interest and gains that built up within the policy were not included as part of the policyholders current income. The reasoning behind this was that the government did not want to be seen taxing beneficiaries – children and widows – which would not go over well politically. The problem, however, was that the generous tax breaks given to insurance policies led people to try to pass investments off as life insurance."
888,Select Mortality Table,"A select mortality table outlines life contingency statistics for a certain period of time. A select mortality table includes mortality data on individuals who have recently purchased life insurance. These individuals tend to have lower mortality rates than individuals who are already insured, due chiefly to the fact that they have most likely just passed certain medical exams required to obtain insurance.","Insurance companies use select mortality tables (and other types of mortality tables) in order to determine proper premiums and fees that must be charged to individuals seeking insurance in order to be profitable. Select, ultimate and aggregate mortality tables can all be used by insurance companies in order calculate the risks associated with individuals seeking insurance."
889,Self-Build Insurance,"Self-build insurance is an insurance policy that provides coverage during the construction of a new home, additional structure, renovation or conversion. Self-build insurance provides financial compensation for setbacks and problems that may occur during the project, such as contractor disputes, accident, injury, death, theft, arson, vandalism and project delays. If the project is being financed with a loan, the lender may require the borrower to purchase self-build insurance.","In addition to covering the project itself, self-buildinsurance often covers materials related to the project. It may also provide legal coverage to the insured in the event of a lawsuit related to the project. Self-build insuranceis primarily used in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In the United States, this product is known primarily as builder's risk insurance."
890,Self-Insurance,"Self-insurance involves setting aside your own money to pay for a possible loss instead of purchasing insurance and expecting an insurance company to reimburse you. With self-insurance, you pay for a cost such as a medical procedure, water damage, theft or a fender bender out of your own pocket rather than filing a claim under your policy with an insurance company.","Insurance is designed to protect against financial losses you cant afford to bear, but for losses that you can afford, self-insurance can save money since you arent paying insurance premiums. When considering self-insurance, youre weighing the certainty of spending money on premiums against the possibility of incurring a loss that you wont be able to turn to insurance to pay for."
891,Settlement Date,"The settlement date is the date when a trade is final, and the buyer must make payment. It is also the payment date of benefits from a life insurance policy. The settlement date for stocks and bonds is usually two business days after the execution date. For government securities and options, it's the next business day. In spot foreign exchange (FX), the date is two business days after the transaction date.","The financial market specifies the number of business days after a transaction thata security or financial instrument must be paid and delivered. This lag between transaction and settlement dates follows how settlements were previously confirmed, by physical delivery. Today, using modern technology, a transaction is electronically processed."
892,Shortfall Cover,A shortfall cover usually refers to acommercial reinsuranceagreement used to temporarily reduce gaps in an insurersreinsurancecoverage. Ashortfallcover is a type of facultative reinsurance designed to protect the insurer if a reinsurance contract is structured insufficiently to cover expected losses.,"The term also refersto consumer or individual insurance that covers a shortfall in coverage, such as when a car is totaled in an accident and the primary insurance only covers the book value of the car, as opposed to its replacement value."
893,Side Collateral,"Side collateral is a pledge that partially collateralizes a loan. The pledge can be a physical asset, financial asset or personal guarantee. While physical or financial assets can be assigned an underlying price or value, personal guarantees depend solely on the character of the borrower. Most commercial lenders will not accept side collateral as a means to secure a loan or line of credit.","Side collateral refers to a situation in which a borrower partially pledges an asset as recourse to the lender in the event that the borrower defaults on the initial loan. Collateralization of assets gives lenders a level of reassurance against default risk, and may also help a borrower receive a loan they were otherwise unable to obtain with less desirable credit history."
894,Side Effect,"Side effect is an undesirable symptom caused by taking a drug or undergoing a therapy. Side effects can range from relatively minor symptoms such as drowsiness or an upset stomach, to serious effects such as liver damage, and sometimes even life-threatening or potentially fatal effects.","A side effect presents a key risk aspect of a drug. While most drugs and therapies have side effects, if the benefit outweighs the risk, then the risk-to-benefit ratio of the drug is favorable and it may receive Food and Drug Administration approval for marketing. Side effects are also calledadverse reactions oradverse effects. Patients and consumers should be thoroughly familiar with the side effects of their prescribed medication, which can be found on the drug label or the medications package insert."
895,Single Entity Coverage,"Single entity coverage is a type of insurance policy that covers all real property in a condominium, including both the common areas shared by all property owners as well as the individual units. Single entity coverage is used for condominiums (or condos), a type of residential property in which some common elements, such as the entryway or light fixtures, are used by all residents of the building, while other elements are only used by the condo unit owner.","Single entity coverage is important for owner-occupiedmultifamily housingbecause the residents ofcondo units cannot be asked to purchase an insurance policy covering items that are shared by other condo owners, such as an entryway or a light fixture in a hallway, so the condominium association purchases this insurance policy, using the fees charged to the condo owners for upkeep."
896,Single Interest Insurance,Single interest insurance covers the interests of one of the two parties that co-own property. This type of insurance typically covers a portion or all of the outstanding value owed to a lender for mortgaged or leased property.,"Single interest insurance typically applies only to the interests of a lender or financing company, since alesseesinterest in the insured property usually overlaps with thelendersinterest.​​​​​​​"
897,Single-Life Payout ,"Single-Life Payout is one of two payout option methods an employer uses to distribute retirement benefits. At retirement, a retiree has the choice of either a single-life payout or a joint-life payout. A single-life payout means only the employee will be receiving the payments for the rest of his/her life, but the payments stop upon his/her death.","In contrast to the single-life payout option, a retiree can also choose a joint-life payout option that will continue payments after the retiree's death to someone else, such as a spouse. Some plans restrict the survivor benefits to immediate family members. Typically, the periodic payment from a joint-life payout option will be less than the amount in a single life payout because it continues after death."
898,Single-Premium Life Insurance,Single-premium life insurance is a type of life insurance that charges the policyholder a single up-front premium payment to fully fund the policy. It was once a popular tax shelter.,"Single-premium life insurance requires a large sum of money from the policyholder that puts this type of insurance out of reach of many applicants. The great advantage to single-premium life insurance is that the single payment fully funds the policy, immediately guaranteeing a sizable death benefit to the beneficiaries."
899,Soft Paper Report,A soft paper report is areference to a lack of confidence in a report's facts or general disrespect for a report's author. A soft paper report should have only one use – as toilet paper – which is how its name was derived.,"A soft paper report is alsoknown as a toilet paper report.Reports are almost always subjective, as even hard facts have to be interpreted. In business, it is important not to rely on everything you hear and read, and instead to do a little homework yourself. Otherwise you could find yourself relying on a report that is only good for toilet paper."
900,Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR),"A solvency capital requirement (SCR) is the amount offunds that insurance and reinsurancecompaniesin the European Union are required to hold. SCR is a formula-based figure calibrated to ensure that all quantifiable risks are considered, including non-life underwriting, life underwriting, health underwriting, market, credit, operational and counterparty risks. The solvency capital requirement covers existing business as well as new business expected over the course of 12 months. Itis required to be recalculated at least once per year.","Solvency capital requirements are part of the Solvency II Directive issued by the European Union (EU) in 2009, which more than a dozenexisting EU directives. The directive aims to coordinate laws and regulations of the 28EU membersas they relate to the insurance industry. If the supervisory authorities determine that the requirement does not adequately reflect the risk associated with a particular type of insurance, it can adjust the capital requirement higher."
901,Special Acceptance,"Special acceptance refers to an agreement by a reinsurer to include, under a reinsurance contract, coverage for a risk not automatically provided for in the original contract.","Specialacceptancesare most commonly found with facultative reinsurance agreements. The word facultative refers to something occurring optionally in response to circumstances, rather than by nature. And the term reinsurance refers to insurance taken out by an insurance company to protect itself."
902,Special Employer,"A special employer is an employer who receives an employee on loan from another business, and who is not the employees original employer. A special employer may be held responsible for the actions of the employee, and the business that lends the employee is generally not held responsible, despite being the permanent employer.","Businesses may let other businesses borrow their employees for a period time. This arrangement is known as a special employer relationship, and it isregulated under the borrowed servant rule. The business that loans out the employee to the special employer is referred to as the general employer. The employee, despite not having a regular employer-employee relationship with the special employer, is considered to have an implied employment contract."
903,Special Needs Child,"A special needs child is a youth who has been determined to require special attention and specific necessities that other children do not. The state may declare this status for the purpose of offering benefits and assistance for the childs well-being and growth. Special needs can also be a legal designation, particularly in the adoption and foster care community, wherein the child and guardian receive support to help them both lead productive lives.",The guardians of special needs children typically receive some sort of additional tax credit or deduction to address the additional costs and efforts that can be required to provide for child care andwellbeing.
904,Special Warranty Deed,A special warranty deed is a deed in which the grantor warrants only against defects occurringduringtheir ownership. The grantor of a special warranty deed does not provide a warranty or guarantee against any defects in clear title that existed before their ownership. A special warranty deed is a variation of the more commonly issued general warranty deed.,"The use of the word ""special"" may communicate to a buyer the idea that the deed is of higher quality than a general warranty deed. In fact, the specialwarranty deedis less comprehensive as it offers less protection against possible defects in aclear title."
905,Spinning,"Spinning is the act of a brokerage firm or underwriter offering shares in an IPO to preferred customers, as a means of retaining or obtaining their business.In theory, spinning benefits both parties; the underwriter or brokerage firm cultivates loyalty and/or a broader client base, while the preferred customer enjoys the benefits, i.e. equity gains, afforded by a dynamic new public company. However, the practice is now illegal, as many considered it unethical.Spinning is also known as ""IPO spinning.""","Spinning is a lucrative means of enticing the business of large companies. By swaying the decision of the top executives, investment brokerage houses can secure a quid pro quo type of arrangement."
906,Split Limits,"Split Limits are a provision of an insurance policy that states different maximum dollar amounts the insurer will pay for different components of a claim. A policy with split limits might pay $100,000 per person per incident for bodily injury, with a maximum of $300,000 per incident. If one person seeks $250,000 in damages for their injuries, the maximum the split limit policy will pay is $100,000, even if only one person is injured in the accident. The only way the split limit policy will pay the $300,000 maximum is if three different people each have $100,000 in claims.","The opposite of a split limit is a combined single limit, which limits the coverage for all components of a claim to one dollar amount. A combined single limit policy states that the insurer will pay up to, say, $300,000for a single claim; it doesnt matter whether one person claims $300,000 in medical bills or whether three injured parties each claim $100,000 in medical bills. The combined single limit maxes out at $300,000 either way."
907,Spot Reinsurance,"A reinsurance agreement that covers a single peril. Spot reinsurance is a used in facultative reinsurance agreements, and allows a ceding company to obtain reinsurance coverage in situations in which a subsection of its total portfolio is considered more risky than the portfolio as a whole.","Insurance companies enter into reinsurance agreements in order to reduce their risk exposure, and pay reinsurance companies to take some (or all) of their underwriting risk off their books. Reinsurance agreements may cover an entire line of business or may cover specific policy types, and may allow the reinsurer to be selective when it comes to which perils it accepts (facultative reinsurance) or may require the insurer to accept a peril automatically (treaty reinsurance)."
908,Sprinkling Provision,Sprinkling provision within a life insurance agreement that allows the trustee of the policy to spread the death benefit around to the beneficiaries at his or her discretion. The sprinkling provision gives the beneficiaries who are in greater need of the funds the opportunity to receive a greater portion of the payout than if the funds were divided equally.,"For example, let's assume that a policyholder recently died and the individual has four children. Let's also assume that two of the children are financially well-off and that the others have recently entered into financial difficulty. The sprinkling provision that is embedded in the insurance contract would enable the trustee to attribute a significant portion of the death benefit to the children in need of the funds and give proportionally less to the ones who do not need the extra money."
909,Standard Auto Insurance,Standard auto insurance refers to the most basic auto insurance offered to drivers who fall into an average risk profile.,"Standard auto insurance takes into account a drivers characteristics, and the premium charge is based off of actuarial information compiled from similar drivers records."
910,State Guaranty Fund,A state guarantyfundis administered by a U.S. state to protect policyholders in the event that an insurance company defaults on benefit payments or becomes insolvent. The fund only protects beneficiaries of insurance companies that are licensed to sell insurance products in that state.,"State guaranty funds exist in all 50states,Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. Most states maintain separate funds for property/casualty insurance and life/health insurance.These state guarantyfunds act as a form of insurance for insurance, and are funded by insurance companies that sell insurance in a given state.The amount of funding an insurance company is required to pay is a percentage, ranging from 1 to 2 percentof the net amount of insurance it sells within any particular state."
911,State Health Insurance Assistance Programs - SHIP,"State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIP) offer free individual insurance counseling at the locallevel for those on Medicare, as well as their families, friends and caregivers. SHIPs are funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Servicesand they are prevalent in all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.","State Health Insurance Assistance Programs counselorsexplain how Medicare works to beneficiaries, including how to take advantage of its benefits and what sorts of fees and deductibles to expect. They also assist people with claims and appeals on their insuranceor any other issuesthe person might have.SHIPsalso provide information on additional options open to Medicare beneficiaries, including variations on their traditional plans and joining a Medicare Advantage Plan."
912,Statutory Liability,"Statutory liability is alegal term meaning that someone can be held responsible for a certain action or omission because of a related law that is not open to interpretation. This is a generic term that can apply to any field, not just finance, but in finance, it may come up in reference to real estate transactions, stockholder obligations or the behavior of board members, to name just a few examples.","In New Zealand and Australia, businesses commonly purchase statutoryliability insurance to protect themselves from the fines, penalties and legal fees that can result from an accidental breach of law. These may include occupational health and safety laws, environmental laws and employment laws."
913,Stranger-Owned Life Insurance - STOLI,"Stranger-owned life insurance (STOLI) is life insurance a person purchases to sell to a third party with no insurable interest, who would therefore be unable to legally purchase the original policy.","Stranger-owned life insurance, or strange-originated life insurance, is a way to bypass the insurable-interest requirement in purchasing a life-insurance policy. To legally purchase life insurance on someone else, the purchaser must have an insurable interest in that persons life. That means the persons death would adversely affect the purchasers finances. Some definitions require that the purchaser and the insured have a loving relationship."
914,Subrogation,Subrogation is a term describinga legal right heldby most insurance carriersto legally pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured. This is done in order to recover the amount of the claim paid by the insurance carrier to the insured for the loss.,"Subrogation literally refers to the act of one person or party standing in the place of another person or party. Subrogation in the insurance sector, especially among auto insurance policies, occurs when the insurance carrier takes on the financial burden of the insured as the result of an injury or accident payment and seeks repayment from the at-fault party."
915,Substandard Insurance,An individual who may not qualify for a standard insurance policy may receive a substandard insurance policy from an insurance provider.,"Substandard insurance policies contain special or restrictiveprovisions and will have higher premiums due to thehigher risk posed by the individual. Since they are considered a higherrisk, it increases the probability that the insurance provider will incur a loss. "
916,Successive Periods,"Successive periods are periods of time that follow one another chronologicallyand which are linked together by a common event. Successive periods are used in contracts when defining how long the contract period will last. A year-long contract, for example, will be comprised of 12successive months, with the first month starting on the effective date and the last month ending on the contract anniversary date. The contract signing is considered the common event linking together the 12months.","Successive periods are used to denote continuation. Someone who purchases a subscription to a monthly magazine, for instance, will receive one issue each month for twelve months, with the string of months considered a successive period of time. The common link between the months is the subscription the person purchased. Insurance companies use successive period calculations when providing benefits to a policyholder, who visits a hospital for the same injury. Each visit is considered part of a successive period, and each visit is considered part of a continuation of the first injury, rather than a new injury."
917,Sunrise Provision,"A sunrise provision, also known as a sunrise clause, is a contract provision that extends coverage to events that occurred before the contract was signed. Insurance and reinsurance contracts use sunrise provisions.","Insurance and reinsurance contracts provide the policyholder protection from specific risks during a predefined period. The period in which the policy remains in effect is one of the most critical aspects of the contract. The effective datelimits the time the insurerisat risk aswellas limiting the time of protection from loss to the insured. In some cases, losses may appear years after the insurance contract's effective term has ended."
918,Surplus Lines Insurance,"Surplus lines insurance protects against a financial risk that is too high for a regular insurance company to take on. Surplus lines insurance, unlike regular insurance, can be purchased from an insurer that is not licensed in the insureds state, though the surplus lines insurer will still need to be licensed in the state where it is based. Aninsurance agent must have a surplus lines license to sell a surplus lines policy. Also called excess lines insurance, surplus lines insurance makes it possible to get insurance for entities with unique risks that most insurers dont cover or those with a claims historiesthat makes them otherwise uninsurable.","Surplus lines insurance carriesadditional risk for the policyholder asthere is no guaranty fund from which to obtain a claim payment ifthe surplus line insurer goes bankrupt. A policyholders claim on a regular insurance policy can be paid out of a state guarantyfund that all the states regular insurance issuers contribute to in case one insurer goes bankrupt. Regular insurance carriers, also called standard or admitted carriers, must follow state regulations about how much they can charge and what risks they can and cannot cover. Surplus lines carriers dont have to follow these regulations, which allows them to take on higher risks."
919,Surplus Share Treaty,A surplus share treaty is areinsurance treaty in which the ceding insurer retains a fixed amount of policy liability and the reinsurer takes responsibility for what remains. Surplus share treaties are considered pro-rata treatiesand are most commonly used with property insurance.,"An insurance company typically considers a surplus share treaty when itunderwrites a new policy. In writing new policies, the insurance companyagrees to indemnify the policyholder up to a specific coverage limit, and in exchange, it receives a premium. In order to reduce its overall liabilities and free up capacity to underwrite new policies, an insurer may cede some of its risks (and premiums) to a reinsurer.How much risk the reinsurer accepts, and under what conditions, is outlined in the reinsurance treaty."
920,Surrender Charge,"A surrender charge is a fee levied on a life insurance policyholder upon cancellation of their life insurance policy. The fee is used to cover the costs of keeping the insurance policy on the insurance provider's books.A surrender charge is alsoknown as a ""surrender fee.""","The surrender charge is usually waived if the insured party informs the insurer in advance of the cancellation of his or her policy, and then continues to pay for a period of time before canceling the policy."
921,Surrender Fee,"A surrender fee is a charge levied against an investor for the early withdrawal of funds from an insurance or annuity contract, or for the cancellation of the agreement. Surrender fees act as an economic incentive for investors to maintain their contract, and they allow the insurance company to have reasonable expectations for the frequency of early withdrawals. A surrender fee is alsoreferred to as a ""surrender charge.""","Surrender feescan apply fortime periods as little as 30 days or as much as15yearson some annuity and insurance products.Surrender fees vary among insurance companies and among annuity and insurance contracts, but a typical annuity surrender fee could be set as a 10 percent(of the funds contributed to the contract) charge levied for withdrawal in the first year. For each successive year of the contract, the surrender fee could drop by 1 percent, for example, effectively giving the annuitant the option of no-penalty withdrawal after 10 years in the contract."
922,Surrender Period,"The surrender period is the amount of time an investor must wait until he or she can withdraw funds from an annuity without facing a penalty. Surrender periods can be many years long, and withdrawing money before the end of the surrender period can result in a surrender charge, which is essentially a deferred sales fee. Generally, but not always, the longer the surrender period, the better the annuitys other terms.","Surrender periodsare meant todiscourage investors from canceling typicallylong-term contracts. Though this might stop an investor from making an emotional, hasty decision in a cyclicalmarket, it may also limit the investor's flexibility to movemoneyout if assets aren't performingwell. Conversely, surrender periods are generally not a problem for investors who don't needliquidityor whoare receiving above-market returns."
923,Surrender Rights,"Surrender rights refer to the ability to cancel an annuity or life insurance contract in exchange for its cash value. Surrendering such a contract early can incur surrender charges, which are fees charged by the company upon cancellation, as well as income tax liability.","Surrender rights are the right of contract holders to cancel a policy in exchange for its cash value. Before exercising a contract's surrender rights, contract holders should determine the contract's cash value, what fees and taxes will be incurred upon surrender, and how much cash they will ultimately net from canceling the contract."
924,Survival Analysis,"Survival analysis, also known as time-to-event analysis, is a branch of statistics that studies the amount of time it takes before a particular event occurs. Providers of life insurance mainly use survival analysisto predict the death of the insured. Yet it also may predict policy cancellations, non-renewals and how long it takes to file a claim. Providers use results from such analyses to help calculate insurance premiums, as well as the lifetime value of clients.","Survival analysismainly comes from the medical and biological disciplines, which leverage itto study rates of death, organ failure and the onset of various diseases. Perhaps for this reason, many associate survival analysis with negative events. However, it also canapplyto positive events, such as how long it might take someone to win the lottery if they play it each week. Over time, survival analysis has been adapted to the biotechnology sector, and also has uses in economics, marketing, machine maintenance and other fields besides insurance."
925,Takaful,"Takaful is a type of Islamic insurance, where members contribute money into a poolsystem in order to guarantee each other against loss or damage. Takaful-branded insurance is based on sharia, Islamic religious law, and explains how it is the responsibility of individuals to cooperate and protect each other.","Takaful insurance companies were introduced as an alternative to commercial insurance companies, which are seen as violating Islamic restrictions on riba (interest), al-maisir (gambling), and al-gharar (uncertainty) principles, and outlawed in sharia."
926,Tandem Plan,"A Tandem Plan is a mortgage purchase program subsidized by the U.S. government. Tandem loans provide monetary assistance to builders and developers of non-profit public housing. Under the Tandem Plan, the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA / Ginnie Mae) buys mortgages at a discounted market price and then sells them through the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA / Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC / Freddie Mac).","Under the Tandem Plan, GNMA foots the difference between the purchase and sale price of the mortgages that it buys. This type of structure allows home buyers to receive low interest rate loans, often to those who would not be able to afford them otherwise."
927,Target Risk (Insurance),Target risk assets are classes of assets excluded from coverage under either insurance policies or reinsurance treaties due to the specific risk they pose. Aseparate insurance policy or reinsurance treaty may cover atarget risk asset.,"When an insurance company underwrites a policy, it agrees to indemnify the policyholder from losses resulting from specific risks. In exchange for assuming this liability, the insurer receives a premium from the policyholder. Insurers base this premium price on historical loss experience, as well as an estimation of the potential frequency and severity of future losses.The insurer may decide that some assets are far riskier than others and may exclude those items from coverage. These assets are target risks, as the insurer hasspecificallyidentified them for exclusion."
928,Term Life Insurance,"Term life insurance, also known as pure life insurance, is life insurance that guarantees payment of a death benefit during a specified term. Once the term expires, the policyholder can either renew for another term, convert to permanent coverage, or allow the policy to terminate. Term life insurance policies provide a stated benefit upon the death of the insured, provided that the death occurs within a specific period.","Term life policies have no value other than the guaranteed death benefit. There is no savings component as is found in a whole life insurance product. The policy's purpose is to give insurance to individuals against the loss of life. All premiums cover the cost of underwriting the insurance. As a result, term life premiums are typically lower than permanent life insurance premiums."
929,Third-Party Claims Administrator,A third-party claims administrator processes claims for a third-party company. Insurance companies and employee benefit providers often employ third-party administrators to process their claims. These administrators also often help to process employee retirement plans and flexible spending accounts.,Third-party claims administrators are used most commonly by health and commercial liability insurance providers.
930,Third-Party Insurance,"Third-party insurance is an insurance policy purchased for protection against the claims of another. One of the most common types is third-party insurance is automobile insurance. Third-partyoffers coverage against claims of damages and losses incurred by a driver who is not the insured, the principal, and is therefore not covered under the insurance policy. The driver who caused damages is the third party.","Third-party insurance is essentially a form of liability insurance purchased by an insured (first party) from an insurer (second party) for protection against the claims of another (third party). The first party is responsible for their damages or losses, regardless of the cause of those damages."
931,Time and Distance Policy,"A time and distance policy is a reinsurance treaty in which an insurer transfers a lump sum of its premiums to a reinsurer, and over time is returned a portion of the unused premiums.",A time and distance policy is a policy designed to transfer timing risk. It does not transfer or otherwise affect underwriting risk.
932,Timeshare,"A timeshare is an ownership model in which many customers own allotments of usage in the same property. The timeshare model can apply to many different types of properties, such as condominiums, homes, campgrounds, vacation resorts, recreational vehicles, and private jets.","With opportunities to rent allotted time each year and sell timeshare interests in the future, many owners of vacation timeshares look at purchasing as an investment. However, this view is frequently misguided."
933,Title Binder,"A title binder is a temporary form of real estate insurance coverage related to the transfer of ownership. A title binder is typically used to protect both the seller and buyer of a real estate property during the transitional phase of a sale when the seller's and buyer's home insurance policies do not necessarily overlap over the same time frame. Although they are not legally required in all cases, title binders are a common protective insurance in real estate transactions.","Title binders may be considered vital in some jurisdictions prior to real estate agencies agreeing to list a property or close a sale. Typical title binders will provide the buyer and seller protection from theft, acts of god and other sorts of physical damage during the closing of a property transaction."
934,Title Insurance,"Title insurance is indemnity insurance that protects the holder from financial loss sustained from defects in a title to a property. The most common type of title insurance is lender's title insurance, which the borrower purchases only to protect the lender. Owner's title insurance, paid for by the seller to protect the buyer's equity in the property, is available separately.","Title insurance protects both real estate owners and lenders against loss or damage occurring from liens, encumbrances, or defects in the titleor actual ownership ofa property. Unlike traditional insurance, which protects against future events, title insurance protects against claims for past occurrences. Such claims include property ownership by another person, fraud or forgery of the title documents, unidentifiedeasements, outstanding lawsuits, liensagainst the property, et al."
935,Tortfeasor,"Tortfeasor is the individual, company, or entity that is found to have committed wrongdoing. Tortfeasors are said to have committed a civil offense – a tort - rather than a criminal offense. Civil offenses are typically disputes between individuals and corporations.","The primary aim of tort law is to provide a remedy for damages suffered by one party and caused by another. A tortfeasor is one accused of causing the damage, and may be sued by a plaintiff in order to recover some of the costs of the damage. In some cases, more than one party may be responsible for the tort – a joint tortfeasor – and the courts will determine how much damage or loss each party is responsible for. Courts may divide up the reparations according to the proportion of the damage each party was responsible for."
936,Total Insurable Value,"Total insurable value (TIV) is the amount an insurance policy covers in terms of property, inventory, equipment, and business income. Total insurable value can include the cost of the insured physical property, as well as the contents of the building, such as machineryand other equipment. If the insurance policy covers a commercial property, income lost, due to damage to the property,can also be included in the total insurable value.","Determining the total insurable value involves conducting a full inventory of a building and its contents. The insurer may provide worksheets to help organize inventory. Businesses may also show specific purchase orders and sales records used for tax purposes. For the insured, it is necessary to include all inventory and other items that are critical to business operations. Exclusion of essential equipment or inventory from total insurable value may result in a costly underestimation after sustaining a loss."
937,Total Permanent Disability (TPD),"Total permanent disability (TPD) is a condition in which an individual is no longer able to work due to injuries. Total permanent disability, also called permanent total disability, applies to cases in which the individual may never be able to work again.","Total permanent disability may involve an individuals loss of the use of his or her limbs, with the injuries preventing the policyholder from being able to work in the same capacity as he or she had before the injury. If the policyholder retires or leaves the workforce for any reason other than the injury,coverage may be stopped."
938,Traditional Whole Life Policy,"A traditional whole life policy is atype of life insurance contract that provides for insurance coverage of the contract holder for his/her entire life. Unlike term life insurance, which covers the contract holder until a specified age limit, a traditional whole life policy never runs out. Upon the inevitable death of the contract holder, the insurance payout is made to the contract's beneficiaries. These policies also include an investment component, which accumulates a cash value that the policyholder can withdraw or borrow against.","A traditional whole lifeinsurance policy provides the policyholder with a guaranteed amount to pass on to his/her beneficiaries, regardless of how long he/she lives, provided the contract is maintained. Most policies also offer a withdrawal clause, which allows the contract holder to cancel his/her coverage and receive a cash surrender value."
939,Transfer of Risk,"A transfer of risk, considered the underlying tenet of insurance transactions, is a risk management technique where risk shifts from one party to another. Risks may transfer between individuals, from individuals to insurance companies, or from insurers to reinsurers. For example, when a person purchases home insurance, they arepaying an insurance company to assume the risks associated with homeownership.","When purchasing insurance, the insurer agrees to indemnify a policyholder up to a certain amount for a specified loss in exchange forpayment. In general, most insurance companies collect millions of dollars in premiums annually. The premiums compensatethe insurance provider for administrative and operating expenses,death or other benefits they must pay out, and profits for the company."
940,Transfer-For-Value Rule,"A transfer-for-value rulestipulatesthat, if a life insurance policy (or any interest in that policy) is transferred for something of value (money, property, etc.), a portion of the death benefit is subject to be taxed as ordinary income. This portion is equal to the death benefit minus the item(s) of value, as well as any premiums paid by the transferee at the time of the transfer. For example, if John Doe sells his $250,000 life insurance policy that he has paid $10,000 in premiums on to Jane Doe for $5,000, the amount subject to income tax is $235,000 ($250,000-$10,000-$5,000).","A transfer-for-value rule includes, but goes beyond, the outright sale of a life insurance policy. The life insurance policy does not lose its tax-exempt status when the policy is transferred to the insured, a partner of the insured or to a company where the insured is an officer or stockholder."
941,Transferable Insurance Policies - TIPS,"Transferable Insurance Policies - TIPS - is a life insurance policy which allows for the transferable assignment of the benefactor. In these cases, the owner sells the policy to an investor at a discount to the face value of the insurance. The purchaser, who becomes the benefactor of the policy, will pay all subsequent premiums and receive the settlement value when the insured person becomes deceased. Also known as a viatical settlement.","Transferable insurance policies have a guaranteed principal, similar to a bond, but an uncertain maturity. Since they are sold at deep discounts, TIPS often have high yields. While TIPS contain no external risks, such as interest rate fluctuations, they do have the risk of an extending maturity. The longer an insured person lives, the less return for the investor."
942,Transferable Underwriting Facility (TRUF),Transferable underwriting facility (TRUF) is a type of underwriting facility that deals in Euro notes. Transferable underwriting facilities allow project managers to transfer their Euro note underwriting commitments to other parties. The receiving party then assumes all responsibility for the underwriting from that point on.,"In a transferable underwriting facility, thetransfer of underwriting commitment must be approved by all parties involved. Both the responsibility and the management of the underwriting are then transferred to the new party. This arrangement allows the original underwriters to satisfy their commitment by moving it to another party that is capable of completing the transaction."
943,Travel Insurance,Travel insurance is a type ofinsurance thatcovers the costs and losses associated with traveling. It is a useful protection for those traveling domestically or abroad.,"Many companies selling tickets or travel packages give consumers the option to purchase travel insurance, also known as travelersinsurance. Some travel policies cover damage to personal property, rented equipment, such as rental cars, or even the cost of paying a ransom. Frequently sold as a package, travel insurance may includeseveral types of coverage.The main categories of travel insurance include trip cancellation or interruption coverage, baggage and personal effects coverage, medical expensecoverage, and accidental death or flight accident coverage."
944,Treaty Reinsurance,"Treaty reinsurance is a type of reinsurance in which the reinsurance company accepts all of a particular type of risk from the ceding insurance company.Treaty reinsurance is one of the three maintypes of reinsurance contracts, the others being facultative reinsurance and excess of loss reinsurance. Treaty reinsurersare obliged to accept all risks outlined in the treaty reinsurance contract.","When insurance companies underwrite a new policy, they agreeto take on additional risk in exchange for a premium. The more policies that an insurer underwrites, the more riskit takes on. One way an insurer can reduce its exposure is to cede some of the risk to a reinsurance company in exchange for a fee. Reinsurance allows the insurer to free up risk capacityand to protect itself from claims of high severity."
945,Triage,Triage is a form of process management that fast tracks patient care in hospitals and healthcare settings. It also is used by companies needing faster workflows for projects under tight deadlines.,
946,Trumpcare,"Trumpcareis a colloquial term referring to Republicans' attempts to repeal and, in some cases, replace the Affordable Care Act during theadministration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Several attempts to pass laws in Congress have failed, so the White House has begun using executive orders to reverse provisions of the Obama administration's health care reform (skip to section).","Trumpcareis meant to be a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. The Republican party has promised to repeal theAffordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, since it passed without a single Republican votein 2010. The party held dozens of votes to repeal the law during the Obama administration, sending one bill to the president's desk in January 2016 (it was vetoed)."
947,Trust-Owned Life Insurance (TOLI),"Trust-owned life insurance is life insurance that resides inside a trust. Trust-owned life insurance is used by many high net worth individuals as the cornerstone of their estate plan. It enables the trust to provide for survivors, cover estate tax liability planning, balance inheritances among heirs and meet charitable objectives.","Life insurance is viewed as a long-term asset that will not be used for its true purpose, ideally, for decades. Consequently, it is often overlooked when monitoring and managing the overall trust. However, it is important that the trust-owned insurance policies be reviewed regularly. The existing policy might not meet the current needs of the trust, and newer insurance products might be more cost efficient and offer better options and features."
948,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a Cabinet-level government department that provides health and human services, and promotes research in social services, medicine and public health. It achieves this through 11 agencies that manage more than 100 programs. The agencies include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).","The Department of Health and Human Services was originallyfounded as a Cabinet-level department in 1953 as the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). In 1979, the Department of Education Organization Law created a separate Department of Education. The remaining agencies were reorganized as the Department of Health and Human Services on May 4, 1980."
949,U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,"The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, established in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan, elevated the previous Veterans Administration to a Cabinet-level executive department, giving it a new name that allowed it to still be referred to by its longtime acronym, theVA. It comprises three administrations – the Veteran's Health Administration, evolved from the first federal solder's facility established for veterans of the Union Army after the Civil War and later joined by a system of veterans hospitals, clinics and nursing home units; the Veterans Benefits Administration, which supervises the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program and other benefits, including employment and education; and the National Cemetery Administration, which runs 147 national cemeteries across the country.","The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' roots stretch back to 1636 when the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony voted that the Colony would support soldiers disabled by its war with the Pequot Indians, according to theirwebsite. During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress of 1776 enacted pensions for disabled soldiers; in the 19th century, support was extended to widows and dependents. Veterans'benefits expanded further during World War I, with the first consolidation of World War I veterans' programs occurring in 1921 when Congress created the Veterans Bureau. In 1930, President Herbert Hoover elevated the Bureau to a federal administration."
950,Uberrimae Fidei Contract,"An uberrimae fidei contract is a legal agreement requiring the highest standard good faith. ""Uberrimae fidei"" or ""uberrima fides"" is Latin for ""utmost good faith."" Insurance contracts are the most common type of auberrimae fidei contract. Because the insurance company agrees to share the risk of loss with the policyholder, it is imperative that the policyholder act in good faith by fully disclosing all information that affects the insurance company's level of risk. Full disclosure allows the insurer to protect itself by charging the policyholder a premium that accurately reflects the level of risk it is undertaking or even refusing to issue a policy if the risk is too high.","Because the insurance applicant often has more information about the risk that is being insured against than the insurer does, the principle of uberrimae fidei is used in an attempt to eliminate moral hazard. For example, someone applying for health insurance knows more about their eating habits, exercise patterns, family medical history and personal medical history than the potential insurer does. In order to determine how risky the applicant is, the insurer requires him or her to honestly answer a medical questionnaire and submit to a review of medical records before being approved for a policy. If the policyholder is later found to not have acted in utmost good faith at the time of application, his policy and benefits can be rescinded."
951,Ultimate Mortality Table,"Ultimate mortality tables list the percentage oflife insurancepurchasers expected to still be alive at each given age, beginning with age 0, which represents 100% of the population, up to age120. Typically, the data is based on a population of life-insurance policyholders from either a particular insurance company or group of companies, rather than the entire U.S. population.","The information underlying ultimate mortality tables is called survivorship data, andtakes into account manyrisk factors. Insurance companies use the data underlying these tables to price insurance products. The profitability of insurance products depends partly on companies' accurately analyzing thedata behind ultimate mortality tables."
952,Ultimate Net Loss,"Ultimate net loss is a party's total financial obligation when an insured event occurs. The insured's ultimate net loss from costs such as property damage, medical expenses and legal fees will be offset by the portion of the loss that is paid by the insurance company (usually the amount of the claim that exceeds the insured's deductible, up to the policy maximum). Thus, the insured's loss will often be limited to the policy deductible unless the total loss exceeds the policy maximum.","An insurance company's ultimate net loss from a claim may be offset by the salvage value of any recoverable items, awards from successful claims against third parties, money from reinsurance and the policyholder's deductible and policy maximum. Ultimate net loss can be a generic term that refers to the total amount of any loss, but in finance, it is most commonly used to refer to an insurance company's total loss from a policyholder's claim."
953,Umbrella Insurance Policy,"An umbrella insurance policy is extra liability insurance coverage that goes beyond the limits of the insured's home, auto or watercraft insurance. It provides an additional layer of security to those who are at risk for being sued for damages to other people's property or injuries caused to others in an accident. It also protects against libel, vandalism, slander and invasion of privacy. An umbrella insurance policy is very helpful when the insurance owner is sued and the dollar limit of the original policy has been exhausted. The added coverage provided by liability insurance is most useful to individuals who own a lot of assets or very expensive assets and are at significant risk for being sued.","The premium for an umbrella insurance policy may be less expensive if the policy is purchased from the same insurer that provided the original auto, home or watercraft insurance. Depending on the provider, the policyholder who wants to add an umbrella insurance policy is required to have a base insurance coverage of $150,000 to $250,000 for auto insurance and $250,000 to $300,000 for homeowners insurance."
954,Umbrella Personal Liability Policy,"An umbrella personal liability policy is extraliabilitycoverage which goes beyond the limits of the insureds home, auto orother liability coverage. It provides an additional layer of security to those who are at risk of high loss if they injure someone else, or someones property.An umbrella policy provides broad coverage, meaning that some claims which would not be covered by a standard policy may have coverage under the umbrella policy. ","Umbrella personal liability insurance is often referred to asexcess liability insurance. It protects savings and other assets from a major lawsuit if a policyholder finds themselves on the wrong end of a damageslawsuit. These lawsuits may exceedthe liability limits of an automobile, homeowners, orother insurance coverage. Anumbrella policy kicks in to pay damages, up to the ceilingstated in the contract."
955,Umpire Clause,An umpire clause refers tolanguage in an insurance policy that provides for a means of resolution by an unbiased third party if an insurer and an insured cannot agree on the amount of a claim payment. An umpire clause is the same thing as an arbitration clause. The arbitration process requires both the insurance company and the policy holder to hire an appraiser of their choosing to assess the damages and the cost to repair them. The umpire will agree with one or perhaps both of the resulting appraisals and that amount will be used to satisfy the claim.,"The umpire clause is closely related to theappraisal clause, which allows apolicyholder to hire an independent appraiser to determine the value of their damages. In turn, the insurance company will also hire their own appraiser. The two appraisers will then get together and select an umpire. The umpire is basically the arbitrator."
956,Unaffiliated Investments,"Unaffiliated investments are stocks, bonds, and other investment holdings in companies neither owned by the insurer nor companies that share joint ownership of securities with the insurer. Unaffiliated investments are often found in the financial statements of insurance companies.","Insurance companies use the proceeds from their underwriting activities for a number of different activities. They set aside funds as loss reserves to cover liabilities that they may incur from policyholders making a claim. They pay commissions to brokers who bring in new business, and pay operational expenses such as salaries, benefits, and overhead. They also use funds to invest in securities of various liquidities to try to increase the return on the premiums they receive."
957,Unallocated Benefit,"An unallocated benefit is a health insurance provision, in which the insurer covers extra hospital expenses up to a predetermined maximum amount, instead of specifying a maximum payment for each individual type of expense.","An unallocated benefit reimburses policy holders for extra hospital expenses, such as the costs of anesthesia, X-rays, lab tests, medications and supplies, all of which may be provided without entirely conforming to a schedule."
958,Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ULAE),"Unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) are expenses that are not attributed to the processing of a specific insurance claim. Unallocated loss adjustment expensesare part of an insurers expense reserves. These are amongthe largest expensesfor whichan insurer has to set aside funds, behind allocated loss adjustment expenses and contingent commissions.","Unallocated loss adjustment expenses, along with allocated loss adjustment expenses, represent an insurer's estimate of the money it will pay out in claims, as well as expenses associated with processing those claims."
959,Unauthorized Insurance,Unauthorized insurance is a phony coverage plan that claims to provide financial protection against unforeseen and potentially catastrophic events. Unauthorized insurance is a scam that some unscrupulous individuals posing as insurance agents use to collect fake premiums from unwitting consumers.,"These individuals take the money and run, leaving consumers lighter in their respective pockets, and without insurance coverage."
960,Unauthorized Insurer,Unauthorized insurer refers to a fraudulent operation in which a company poses as an authorized provider of a financial protection plan when it is not one. Unauthorized insurers take advantage of consumers and sometimes even insurance agents to collect premiums on nonexistent policies. It is illegal for unauthorized insurers to conduct business.,Unauthorized insurer operations cause their victims to lose their premium money and find themselves exposed to large potential losses that would have been protected by a legitimate insurance policy.
961,Unbundled Life Insurance Policy,An unbundled life insurance policy is a type of financial protection plan that provides cash to beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death. A unbundled life insurance policy contains a savings and investment component that the policyholder can use during his or her lifetime or pass on to beneficiaries. This does not expire when the policyholder reaches a certain age; and that allows the policyholder to adjust the amount and timing of premium payments and the amount of the death benefit while the policy is in force.Unbundled life insurance is another word for universal life insurance.,"Both whole and universal/unbundled life insurance are types of permanent life insurance thathave a cash value component, in which a portion of each premium payment is saved and invested on the policyholder's behalf. The other portion of the premium goes toward administrative expenses and the death benefit."
962,Underbanked,"Underbanked refers to families that prefer to manage their finances through cash transactions instead of more traditional financial services such as checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards and loans.","Although some households are considered unbanked because they do not use banks or financial services at all, the underbanked segment of the population may have checking or savings accounts, but often access less traditional financial products and services, such as short-term payday loans and check cashing services."
963,Underinsurance,"Underinsurancerefers to inadequate insurance coverageheldby a policyholder. In the event of a claim, underinsurance may result in economic losses to the policyholder, since the claim would exceed the maximum amount that can be paid out by the insurance policy. While underinsurance may result in lower premiums paid by the policy holder, the loss arising from a claim may far exceed any marginal savings in insurance premiums.","Underinsurance can cause a serious financial crisis, depending on the asset that is insured and the extent of the shortfall in insurance. For example, assume a house and its contents are insured against all risks for $250,000, with a deductible of $20,000. It is subsequently destroyed in a fire, but the cost to replace the house and contents amounts to $350,000. The homeowner will have to make up the difference of $100,000 plus the $20,000 deductible from his or her own resources."
964,Underinsured Motorist Coverage,"Underinsured motorist coverage is an auto insurance policy provision which extends coverage to include property and bodily damage caused by a motorist who has insufficientauto insurance of their own. Underinsured motorist coverage is designed to provide the injured party with compensation above the limit of the at-faultparty's policy. Underinsured coverage is not the same as uninsured coverage, which includes cases where the at-fault driver had no insurance at all.","​​​​​​​Underinsured motorist coverage usually adds only nominal expense to an auto insurance policy cost, butprovides beneficial coverage. This coverage will become useful during an accident where the driver who was found to be at-fault does not have enough insurance to cover the cost of damages from the crash."
965,Underinsured Motorist Endorsement,Anunderinsured motorist endorsement is atype of supplementalautomobile insurance that offers additional coverage to the policyholder in the event of an accident that is the result of another driver whose policy does not cover the total costs of the accident .,"An underinsured motorist endorsement is an added provision or attachment an individual can add to their automobile insurance policy. An underinsured motorist endorsement provides insurance coverage to the policyholder and his or her passengers in the event of an accident caused by a driver who does not have sufficient coverage. The underinsured motorist endorsement covers bodily injury to the policyholder, insured members of the holder's household and passengers, and may also cover property damage. The endorsement typically pays the difference between what the other driver's insurance covers and what the underinsured motorist coverage will pay, subject to the maximum limit of the coverage."
966,Underlying Mortality Assumption,"Underlying mortality assumptions are projections of expected death rates used by actuaries to estimate insurance premiums and pension obligations. This is based on mortality tables, which are statistical tables of expected annual mortality rates. Because of the critical importance of the underlying mortality assumption, actuaries have to follow guidelines set by pension and insurance regulators in deciding on an appropriate assumption.",Also called the mortality assumption.
967,Underlying Retention,Underlying retention is the net amount of riskor liabilityarising from an insurance policy or policiesthat is retained by a ceding company after reinsuring the balance amount of the risk or liability. The degree of underlying retention will vary depending on the ceding company's assessment of the risks involved in retaining part of the policy liability and the profitability of the insurance policy.,"Underlying retention enables an insurer to avoid payment of the reinsurance premium. The insurer will generally retain the most profitable policies or their lowest-risk componentswhile reinsuring less profitable, higher-risk policies. Reinsurance, also known as insurance for insurers or stop-loss insurance, is the practice of insurers transferring portions of risk portfolios to other parties by some form of agreement to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from aninsurance claim. The party that diversifies its insuranceportfoliois known as the ceding party. The party that accepts a portion of the potential obligation in exchange for a share of theinsurance premiumis known as thereinsurer."
968,Underpricing,"Underpricing is the listing of an initial public offering (IPO) below its market value. When the offer price of a stock is lower than the price of the first trade, the stock is considered to be underpriced. Typically, a stock is temporarily underpriced because demand will eventually drive it toward its intrinsic value.",
969,Underwriter,"An underwriter is any party that evaluates and assumes another party's risk for a fee, such as a commission, premium, spread or interest. Underwriters operatein many aspects of the financial world, including the mortgage industry, insurance industry, equity markets, andcommon types of debt securities.","Underwriters can play a variety of specific roles, dependingon the context of afinancial situation. Generally, they are considered to be the risk experts of the financial world. Investors rely on themto determine if a business risk is worth taking. They can also contribute tosales-type activities, as they do in theinitial public offering (IPO) process and in the reselling of debt securities."
970,Underwriters Association,An underwriters association is an industry group dedicated to maintaining and providing continuing education and networking opportunities for underwriters.,"An underwriters association offers members a variety of professional development services. These typically include online learning seminars, discounts on attendance at professional conferences, discounts on subscriptions to various publications and business development tools. These associations are generally non-profit entities funded by membership dues."
971,Underwriters Laboratories - UL,"Underwriters Laboratories (UL) is a global safety science company, and the largest and oldest independent testing laboratory in the United States. Underwriters Laboratories tests the latest products and technologies for safety before they are marketed around the world. It tests over 19,000 different products annually, ranging from consumer electronics, alarms and security equipment, to lasers, medical devices and robotics.","Founded in 1894, which means that it has over 120 years of service and experience, Underwriters Laboratories offers its services in five strategic areas, from product safety, environment, life & health, university and verification services."
972,Underwriting,"Underwriting is the process by which investment bankers raise investment capital from investors on behalf of corporations and governments that are issuing either equity or debt securities. The word ""underwriter"" originated from the practice of having each risk-taker write his name under the total amount of risk he was willing to accept at a specified premium. This centuries-old practice continues, in a way, as new issues are usually brought to market by an underwriting syndicate, in which each firm takes the responsibility, as well as the risk, of selling its specific allotment.","Underwriters also research and assess the risk each applicant presents. This helps to create the market for securities by accurately pricing risk and setting fair premium rates that adequately cover the true cost of insuring policyholders. If a specific applicant's risk is deemed too high, underwriters may refuse coverage."
973,Underwriting Agreement,"An underwriting agreement is a contract between a group of investment bankers who form an underwriting group or syndicate, and the issuing corporation of a new securities issue. The underwriting agreement contains the details of the transaction, including the underwriting group's commitment to purchase the new securities issue, the agreed-upon price and the initial resale price.","The underwriting agreement can be considered the contract between a corporation issuing a new securities issue and the underwriting group that has agreed to purchase and then resell the issue for a profit. The purpose of the underwriting agreement is to ensure that all of the players understand their responsibility in the process, thus minimizing potential conflict."
974,Underwriting Capacity,Underwriting capacity is the maximum liability that an insurance company is willing to assume from its underwriting activities. Underwriting capacity represents an insurers ability to retain risk.,"An insurance companys potential for profitability depends on its appetite for risk. The more risk it assumes by underwriting new insurance policies, the more premiums it collects and later invests. When an insurer accepts additional hazards, through the issuance of policies, the possibility increases that it may become insolvent. A company'sunderwriting capacity, or the maximum amount of acceptable risk, is a crucial component of its operations."
975,Underwriting Cycle,"Underwriting cycle refers to fluctuations in the insurance business over a period of time. A typical underwriting cycle spans a number of years, as market conditions for the underwriting business go from boom to bust and back to boom again. Underwriting cycle is also known as""insurance cycle.""","The underwritingcycle represents the ebb and flow of businessbetweensoft andhard insurance markets.At the beginning of an underwritingcycle,business is soft due to increased competition and excess insurance capacity, as a result of which premiums are low. Then, a natural disaster or other eventleads to a surge in insurance claims, which drives lesser-capitalized insurers out of business."
976,Underwriting Expenses,"Underwriting expenses are costs and expenditures associated with underwriting activity. Underwriting expenses include a wide range of expenditures, and the exact definition differs for insurers and investment banks. As a major expense category, the lower these expenditures are as a proportion of underwriting activity, the higher the profitability of the insurer or investment bank.","For an insurer, underwriting expenses may include direct costs such as business acquisition, actuarial reviews and inspections, as well as indirect costs such as commissions paid and accounting, legal and customer service expenses. For an investment bank, underwriting expenses would include such costs as due diligence activities and research, legal and accounting fees."
977,Underwriting Fees ,"Underwriting fees are monies collected by underwriters for performing underwriting services. Underwriters work in a variety of markets including investments, mortgages and insurance. In each situation, the underwriter's jobs vary slightly yet each collects underwriting fees in exchange for his or her underwriting services.","Incapital markets, underwriting fees are collected by underwriters who administer the issuing and distributing of certain financial instruments. When companiesissuestock,bondsor other publicly traded securities, for instance, it hires anunderwriter."
978,Underwriting Income ,"Underwriting income is profit generated by an insurer's underwriting activity over a period of time. Underwriting income is the difference between premiums collected on insurance policies by the insurerand expenses incurred and claims paid out. Huge claims and disproportionate expenses may result in an underwriting loss, rather than income, for the insurer. The level of underwriting income is an accurate measure of the efficiency of an insurer's underwriting activities.","An insurer's underwriting income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, with natural and other disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and fires leading to huge underwriting losses. Hurricane Katrina, the largest natural catastrophe in US history, caused an underwriting loss of $2.8 billion for the US property/casualty insurance industry in the first nine months of 2005, compared with underwriting income of $3.4 billion in the corresponding period of 2004."
979,Underwriting Risk,Underwriting risk is the risk of loss borne by an underwriter.,"In insurance, underwriting risk may arise from an inaccurate assessment of the risks associated with writing an insurance policy or from uncontrollable factors. As a result, the insurer's costs may significantly exceed earned premiums."
980,Underwriting Standards,"Underwriting standards are guidelines established to ensure that safe and secure loans are issued and maintained. The underwriting standards in place help to set benchmarks for how much debt may be issued to a person, the terms of the loans, how much debt a specific company is willing to issue, and what interest rates will be charged.","Sound underwriting standards protectfinancial institutions from excessive risks that can lead tolosses. History indicatesthat lending andunderwriting standards are generally pro-cyclical. As competitive pressures increase for loan growth, banks may be enticed to ease underwriting standards to expand the loan portfolio in order to generate earnings. As conditions begin to deteriorate, this easing of underwriting standards, if carried too far, causes banks to face increased risk that is followed by rising losses and an eventual tightening of underwriting standards."
981,Undivided Account,"An undivided account, or eastern account, is an offering of a new issue in which underwriters are jointly and severally responsible for placing the total offering. Each underwriting firm is liable for placing unsold portions of the issue from other underwriters.","In an undivided account, for example, an underwriting firm could be responsible for placing 15 percentof an issue and does so. If the entire issue is not placed, the firm must assist in placing the remainder, even if it is greater than the original 15 percent. This contrasts with a divided, or western account, in which underwriters are liable for placing only their assigned percentage of the offering. The share of liability is divided among the underwriters by the size of their allotment of the investment vehicle."
982,Unemployment Claim,"An unemployment claim is a request made by an individual to the state government to receive temporary payments after having been laid off from a job. The United States Department of Labor keeps track of the number of weekly unemployment claims. It provides both seasonally adjusted and seasonally unadjusted claims numbers and also lists which states had an increase or decrease of 1,000 or more claims. Thisdata isreported in the media as an indication of national and state economic health. An unemployment claim is alsoknown as an ""unemployment insurance claim"" or an ""unemployment compensation claim.""","Unemployment claims are paid from state funds that are collected from employers in the form of an unemployment insurance tax. In order to encourage workers to get another job, unemployment benefits are payable for a limited number of weeks and are designed to pay less than a worker would make at a job. To file an unemployment claim, a worker must meet certain criteria. For example, workers receiving unemployment benefits must be actively seeking employment (and be able to prove it) and they must have been laid off rather than having quit or been fired."
983,Unemployment Compensation,"Unemployment compensation ispaid by the state to unemployed workers who have lost their jobs due to layoffs or retrenchment. Unemployment compensation is meant to provide a source of income for jobless workers until they can find employment. In order to be eligible for it, certain criteria must be satisfied by an unemployed worker, such as having worked for a minimum stipulated period and actively looking for employment. Unemployment compensation provides partial income replacement only for a defined length of time or until the worker finds employment, whichever comes first. It's also known as unemployment insurance or unemployment benefits.","Unemployment compensation is paid by many developed nations and some developing economies. In the United States, unemployment compensation was ushered in by the Social Security Act of 1935, when the economy was struggling through the Depression. The Americanunemployment compensation system is jointly managed by the federal and state governments and financed through payroll taxes on employers in most states. In the United States, policies vary by state, but unemployment benefits will usuallypay eligible workers up to $450 per week.Benefits are generally paid by state governments, funded in large part by state and federal payroll taxes levied against employers.In Canada, the system is called Employment Insurance and is funded by premiums paid by both employers and employees."
984,Unemployment Insurance,"Unemployment insurance is an insurance by which people may receive benefits ifthey have faultlessly lost their jobs and meet other eligibility criteria. Workers who voluntarily terminate employment, and those who are self-employed, are not eligible for unemployment insurance and must use personal funds to cover situations when no work is available. State governments pay unemployment insurance from a fund of unemployment taxes collected from employers.",
985,Unfair Claims Practice,"Unfair claims practice is theimproper avoidance of a claim by an insurer or an attempt to reduce the size of the claim. By engaging in unfair claims practices an insurer tries to reduce its costs. However, this is illegal in many jurisdictions.","The National Association of Insurance Commisioners (NAIC) has created model unfair claims practicelegislation that mandatesclaims be handled fairly and that there beclear communication between the insurer and the insured. Because of this legislation, many states have implemented unfair claims practice laws."
986,"Uniform Policy Provisions, Health Insurance ","Uniform policy provisions refers to a set of clauses, some mandatory and some optional, that states require or permit insurance companies to include in written insurance policies. Each state has a uniform individual accident and sickness policy provisions law which dictates precisely the provisions that must appear in any insurance policy. In general, the state requires 12 mandatory provisions and gives the insurance company discretion to include any of 11 optional provisions when writing a policy.","Uniform policy provisions provide insurance carriers with a list of required and optional items to include when writing an insurance policy. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners(NAIC) played a leading role in developing the list of provisions. Each state has implemented its own version of the uniform individual accident and sickness law, which lays out specific requirements. The states can customize their requirements as long as those adjustments do not infringe on the rights of the insured."
987,Unilateral Extended Reporting Period Provision,"A unilateral extended reporting period provision is aninsurance contract provision that allows the insured to extend the period of time in which coverage is provided in the case that the insurer decides to cancel or not renew the insurance contract. Unilateral extended reporting period provisions are add-ons, and insured parties must pay an additional fee in order to have this provision.","A unilateral extended reporting period provisionis also known as one-way tail extended reporting provisions.Individuals and businesses that purchase claims-made liability insurance policies may ultimately not continue to use the same policy for a number of reasons. The policy may be replaced with a different type of liability policy, such as an occurrence policy; it may be replaced with a claims-made policy with a different retroactive date, which is more beneficial to the policyholder because it covers claims from a longer period of time; or it may be canceled or not renewed."
988,Uninsurable Peril,"Uninsurable Peril are Events or situations that insurance coverage is not available for, or which insurance companies are unlikely to provide policies for. An uninsurable peril is typically something that has a high risk of occurrence, meaning that the probability of a payout by the insurance company is high and expected. Perils that are not covered are typically catastrophic in nature.","An example of an uninsurable peril would be if an individual builds a home in an area known for flooding. Since the area has a history of the particular peril (i.e. a flood) occurring, it is unlikely that an insurance company will want to extend flood coverage because of the difficulty in managing the potential risk. It's the reason why flood insurance exists as a national government program."
989,Uninsurable Risk,"Uninsurable risk is a condition that poses unknowable or unacceptable risk of loss or a situation in which the insurance would be against the law. Insurance companies limit their losses by not taking on certain risks that are very likely to result in a loss. Many states offer insurance for otherwise uninsurable risks through their ""high-risk pools.""However, lifetime benefits may be capped and premiums may be expensive.","Uninsurable risks are thosethat would bring down an insurance pool, so they can't be taken on for regular coverage.The basic concept ofinsurance is that it spreads risk among a large group of people, so they can protect against a large loss by making a small insurance payment. For insurance to work, most of the group has to gowithout a loss. Otherwise, the insurance company runs out of money."
990,Uninsured Certificate Of Deposit,"An Uninsured Certificate Of Deposit is a certificate of deposit (CD) which is not insured against losses. Due to the lack of insurance, these CDs yield a higher interest rate, as the purchaser assumes all of the risk. In the event that the financial institution or entity that issued the CD goes bankrupt, the purchaser loses the investment.","Most certificates of deposit are insured by either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),or in the case of credit unions, by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA). These institutions would pay CD holders up to certain limitin the event that the lending financial institution was insolvent."
991,Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UM),"Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage is a provision on an auto insurancepolicywhich provides coverage whena driverwithout insurance is found at-fault for an accident.It is an add-on to a standard auto policy thatpays for injuries to the policyholder and passengers, and in some instances for damage to property ifthe other driver islegally responsible for the accident. Not all states will require insurancepolicies to include uninsured motorist coverage.","Uninsured coverage is not the same as underinsured coverage, which includes when the at-fault driver does not have enough insurance to satisfy your damages claims fully. "
992,Unisex Legislation,Unisex legislation is relatively new and prohibits insurance companies from taking into consideration gender when issuing policies.,"Unisex legislation states that all people, regardless of gender, must be treated the same by insurers when setting rates and product offerings.Even though gender is not a factor when determining insurance rates, there are many examples across multiple forms of insurance where one gender is paying more than the other. A commonly found example of this is with automobile insurance, where men, especially young men, pay higher rates than women.From a legal standpoint, this is not due to gender, but instead to how the claims and risks are historically trending."
993,United States Aircraft Insurance Group - USAIG,"United States Aircraft Insurance Group - USAIG- is the nation's first aviation insurance company, founded in 1928 by World War I flying ace Reed McKinley Chambers and pilot David C. Beebe. The United States Aircraft Insurance Group was founded when Chambers realized a need for aviation insurance after the airline company that he had formed - Florida Airways - faced bankruptcy when four airplanes were lost to storms and one accident in 1926. Florida Airways had earned the first private air mail contract awarded by the United States government.","On July 1, 2003, USAIG celebrated its 75th anniversary. The insurance company is credited with furthering aviation by insuring historic events such as the first B-52 bomber flight, the Boeing 707 prototype, the 1969 lunar module flight, the Boeing 747's first commercial flight, and the development and testing of General Dynamics' F-111A fighter jet. In 1968, USAIG's founder Reed Chambers broke the sound barrier while flying in a Convair F-106 Delta Dart. USAIG also is active in promoting safety in flying, and publishes a series of Safety First posters several times each year."
994,United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI),"The United States Government Life Insurance was a life insurance program established in 1919 to provide term, permanent and endowment insurance up to $10,000 to veterans who served in the United States military prior to 1940. The United States Government Life Insurance program was developed to manage the existing World War I policies and any new policies thereafter. More than four million life insurance policies had been issued during WWI. The program was closed to new issues on April 25, 1951.","All premiums paid intoUnited States Government Life Insurance (USGLI) aredeposited and covered into the U.S. Treasury to the credit of the United States Government Life Insurance Fund. Funds areavailable for the payment of losses, dividends, refunds, and other benefits provided for under such insurance, including such liabilities stipulated injudgments ofa district court of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and for the reimbursement of administrative costs."
995,Universal Life Insurance,"Universal life insurance is permanent life insurance with an investment savings element and low premiums like term life insurance. Most universal life insurance policies contain a flexible premium option. However, some require a single premium (single lump-sum premium) or fixed premiums (scheduled fixed premiums).","A universal life insurance option provides more flexibility than whole life insurance. Policyholders have the flexibility to adjust their premiums and death benefits.Universal life insurance premiums consist of two components:a cost of insurance (COI) amount, and a saving component, known as the cash value."
996,Unrecorded Deed,An unrecorded deed is a deed for realproperty that neither the buyer nor the seller has delivered to an appropriate government agency.,"Unrecorded deeds can present many issues for sellers, or grantors, and buyers, or grantees. A deed transfers specific rights of ownership to a piece of real property between two parties. Most jurisdictions require that sellers file an original deed with a government agency that maintains such records in a given municipality. In the United States, this often takes place at the county level. This record serves to notify the public of the sale of property, which in turn provides assurance of current ownership to any entity involved in transactions affected by the property, such as the issuance of a mortgage or a home equity loan, where the property serves as collateral."
997,Unscheduled Property Floater,"Unscheduled property floater refers to an addition to an existing property-insurance policy that provides coverage for items that have not been individually itemized or valued. An unscheduled property floater usually provides coverage against damage, theft or loss of these items. The additional cost is generally much lower than the original policy premium.","Unscheduled property floaters, also called blanket floaters, break down into two separate definitions."
998,Unsolicited Application,An unsolicited application is a request for life insurance coverage that is made by an individual rather than an insurance agent or broker.Insurers generally scrutinize these applications because of the likelihood of self-selection. Self-selection refers to the probability that individuals with poorer risks will seek insurance on their own instead of through an insurance professional.,"A person with a suspected or known health problem, such as heart disease, may try to submit an unsolicited application to purchase life insurance before seeking medical treatment for the condition. These applicants could weigh the insured pool towards bad risks, and as such, the insurers try to screen out self-selection applicants either by requiring higher rates or by denying coverage altogether."
999,Up-Front Mortgage Insurance (UFMI),"Up-front mortgage insurance is an insurance premium that is collected, typically on Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, at the time the loan is initially made. It is in contrast to private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is collected by the lender each month when a buyer's down payment is less than 20 percentof the purchase price. Up-front mortgage premiums are added to a pool of money that is used to help entities, such as the FHA, insure loans for certain borrowers.","Many people do not realize that premiums for up-front mortgage insurance can usually be refundedon a pro-rated basis, if a home is sold within the first five to seven years of ownership. In other words, if someone has paid this premium up front and then sold their home within a few years of their original purchase, they may be entitled to a substantial refund even years after the fact."
1000,Use and Occupancy Insurance – U&O,"Use and occupancy insurance, or U&O, is anobsoletename for what is now called business interruption insurance or business income coverage. It is a type of insurance that covers against the loss of use of machinery or property due, and the loss of income from this, to damage resulting from a named peril or hazard, such as a fire or natural disaster. Use and occupancy insurance provides certain coverage through endorsements to property/casualty insurance policiesif the equipment or property can no longer be used.","Use and occupancy insurance (U&O), now known as business interruption insurance or business income coverage, is insurance that reimburses the policyholder for lost business income when a covered incident makes the business location or equipment unusable. Covered incidents include situations like fires, floods, hurricanes and other disasters that are written into the policy. If a disaster or situation occurs that makes the business location or equipment unusable but this disaster is not written into the insurance coverage, insurance will not pay for the lost business income."
1001,"Usual, Customary and Reasonable Fees","Usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) fees areout-of-pocket fees that a healthinsurance policyholder must pay for services. UCR feesare based on the services provided to the policy holders, as well as the area of the country where the services are being provided.","A fee is considered usual, customary and reasonable if:"
1002,Valuable Papers Insurance,"Valuable papers insurance is a special type of property-casualty insurance. Valuable papers insurance will reimburse the policyholder for the monetary value of any valuable papers such as wills, trusts or corporate charters, that are lost for any reason. It is often purchased by corporations, small businesses and wealthy people.","Valuable papers insurance protects businesses from the expensive and often time-consuming process of replacing important documents. The coverage limits for valuable papers insurance can be very high in some cases, however, the coverage is always limited to either the actual monetary value of the papers themselves or their replacement value. Furthermore, the papers insured must always be carefully guarded in an appropriate fashion in order to file a claim."
1003,Valuation Clause,"The valuation clause is a provision in some insurance policies which specify the amount of moneythe policyholder will receive from the insurance provider if a covered hazardevent occurs. Thisclause stipulates a fixed amount tobe paidin the event of a lossfor an insured property. Several types of valuation clauses can be written, including replacement cost, actual cash value, stated amount and agreed value. ","Any policy which contains a valuation clause should be carefully reviewed to understand the circumstances when a benefit payment is necessary. Also, a policyholder should do a regular review of the listed dollar value for the property. Values which do not keep up with the reasonable cost of living, inflation, or changes to the local Building Code cost increases may not adequatelyprotect the policyholder.Valuation clauses have a basis on an array of different factors about the specific property and individual budget requirements."
1004,Valuation Mortality Table,A valuation mortality table is a statistical chart that is used by insurance companies to calculate the statutory reserve and cash surrender values of life insurance policies. A mortality table shows the death rate at any given age in terms of the number of deaths that occur for every thousand individuals of that age; it provides statistics regarding the likelihood that a person of a given age will live X number of years. This allows the insurance company to assess risks in policies.,A valuation mortality table typically has a safety margin integrated into the mortality rates to protect the insurers. Life insurance companies use valuation mortality tables to determine the amount of liquid assets that they are required by statute to set aside for claims and benefits - the legal reserve.
1005,Valuation Premium,"Valuation premium is a rate set by a life insurance company based on the value of the company's policy reserves. A companys policy reserve represents the present value of the future cash flows of an insurance policy, and the total liability of the insurer is the sum of the actuarial reserves for every individual policy.","Valuation premium is a life insurance calculation that bases charges for premiums on the company's liabilities. At times, an insurance company may opt to set a premium lower than the calculated valuation premium if their experience and statistical records indicate that a lower premium is justified. In the event that a lower premium is charged, the insurance company would be obligated to hold the difference in a deficiency reserve."
1006,Valuation Reserve,Valuation reserves are assets that insurance companies set aside per state law to mitigate the risk of declines in the value of investments they hold.,"Because policies such as life insurance, health insurance and various annuities may be in effect for extended periods of time, these reserves protect the insurance company from losses from investments that may not perform as expected. This helps assure that policy holders are paid for claims and that annuity holders receive income even if an insurance companys assets lose value."
1007,Value Of Risk (VOR),Value of risk (VOR) is the financial benefit that a risk-taking activity will bring to the stakeholders of an organization. It requires the organization to determine whether an activity will help to move it closer to completing its objectives.,"In financial theory, corporations dont have any risk preferences, but the shareholders and stakeholders of the corporation do. All activities that a company may undertake, from entering a new market to developing a new product, carry risk. The amount of risk depends on the type of activity and the likelihood that the company will not be able to recoup costs, with the added knowledge that spending money on one activity carries with it an opportunity cost--i.e. the company cannot use that money on something else."
1008,Value Reporting Form,"The Value Reporting Formis an insurance report used to provide the information necessary for a variable coverage amounts needed bya business which holds irregular inventories throughout the year. The irregular inventory may be differences in the quantity, quality, specific items held.The Value Reporting Form periodically reports the values of this shifting stockto the insurance provider. The insurer,in turn, adjusts the amount of coverage to reflect the value of the current inventory. Using a value reporting form can help the company avoid being over- or underinsured. You may also see this form under the name of a Stock Reporting Form. ","It is critical for a company to maintain adequate insurance to cover hazards, and the Value Reporting Form is an essential tool in determining the proper commercial property insurance levels.Somebusiness commerce requires a company to have inventories that vary significantly throughout the year depending on seasonal factors,consumer needs,and fluctuations in supply and demand."
1009,Valued Marine Policy,"A valued marine policy is a type of marine insurance coverage that places a specific value on the insured property, such as the hull or cargo of a shipping vessel, prior to the event of a loss. In the absence of fraud, a valued marine policy will pay the specified value if a loss occurs. It differs from an unvalued, or open, marine policy, in which the value of the property would need to be proven subsequent to a loss through the production of invoices, estimates and other evidence.","A valued marine policys monetary value is pre-determined and stated in the policy document, therefore making clear any questions about the value of the reimbursements in case of a total or partial loss to the ships, cargo and terminals covered under the policy. This serves to avoid disputes as to the value of the insured property, and there is generally no reassessment or revaluation necessary if an insured event or loss were to occur. Such policies are distinguished in a policy by the words valued ator so valued."
1010,Valued Policy Law (VPL),"Valued policy law (VPL) is a statute that requires insurance companies to pay the full value of a policy to the insured in the event of a total loss. Valued policy law does not consider the actual cash value of the insured property at the time of the loss; instead, the law mandates total payment.","Not all states within the United States have these laws. States that do have valued policy laws include Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Wisconsin was the first state to pass a Valued Policy Law in 1874."
1011,Values,"Values are the worth of a non-forfeiture clause that specifies that an insured party would receive the equity from a life insurance policy, in the event that the policy were canceled because the premium payments were not made. The policy's value would be returned to the policy holder in some manner, either through a partial refund of the premiums that had been paid to date, or through the payment of a portion of the benefits.","Life insurance policy holders can select one of four non-forfeiture benefit options: the cash surrender value, extended term insurance, loan value and paid-up insurance. If the policy holder does not make a selection, the terms of the policy will generally stipulate which option would go into effect, in the event that the policy lapses or is surrendered."
1012,Vandalism And Malicious Mischief Insurance,"Vandalism and malicious mischief insurance is a type of insurance coverage that protects against losses sustained as a result of vandals.Vandalism and malicious mischief insurance is included in most basic commercial and homeowner policies. It is important for properties that are not occupied during well-known periods of the day, such as with churches and schools. While these structures are unoccupied, they become targets by vandals because the vandals know there is reduced risk of being caught.","This coverage typically carries a higher deductible for properties that are known to be unoccupied for certain hours of the day due to the risk and frequency of loss (such as churches and schools). Vandalism and mischief is described as the intentional injury or destruction of property. Vandalism and malicious mischief can be written as an endorsement to standard policies, such as the standard fire policy, in the event that the policy requires a separate endorsement for this type of coverage."
1013,Vandalism Endorsement,A vandalism endorsement is an optional insurance coverage that can be added to basic hazard or property insurance providing remuneration if the property is intentionally damaged by criminals.,"A vandalism endorsement was created to protectproperty owners and tenants from damages caused by breaking and entering or graffiti undertaken as a criminal act. This insurance coverage is a good option for buildings to be unoccupied for long periods of time, such as vacant commercial properties and schools. These cases are more susceptible to vandalism and more likely to need this supplemental coverage."
1014,Vanishing Premium ,A vanishing premium is a fee paid for an insurance policy until the cash value of the policy grows enough to cover the fee.,"A vanishing premium provides a holder of a life insurance policy with an optionto pay premiums from the cash accrued in the policy rather than via payments made by the insured. The premium only vanishes in the sense that the policyholder no longer has to pay it out of pocket after a period of time. The funds for the premiums simply come out of the dividends thrown off by the cash accrued in the investment. This allows the policyholder to put cash otherwise needed for premiums to some other, more lucrative use. It also guarantees the insurance coverage will not lapse, as the premium payments get made automatically."
1015,Vanishing Premium Policy,"A vanishing premium policy is a form of permanent life insurance in which a consumer can use the dividends from such a policy to pay the premium. Over time, the cash value of the policy increases to the point where dividends earned by the policyholder equal the premium payment. At this point, the premium is said to disappear, or vanish.","Vanishing premium policies may be appropriate for consumersworried about longer-term fluctuations in income, such as the self-employed, people who wish to start a business or individuals who wish to retire early."
1016,Variable Death Benefit,"Variable death benefit refers to the amount paid to a decedent's beneficiary that is based on the performance of an investment account within a variable universal life insurance policy, a financial product that functions as both insurance and an investment. This variable amountis in addition to a guaranteed death benefit, which is constant.","A variable universal life policyholder can choose among several investment options their insurer offers, including investments in equity and fixed-income mutual funds. The variable amount, or the policy's cash value, along with guaranteed death benefit, known asits face value, together form the total death benefit."
1017,Variable Life Insurance,"Variable life insurance is a permanent life insurance product with separate accounts comprised of various instruments and investment funds, such as stocks, bonds, equity funds, money market funds, and bond funds.",
1018,Variable Survivorship Life Insurance,"Variable survivorship life insurance is a type of variable life insurance policy that covers two individuals and pays a death benefit to a beneficiary, only after both people have died. Variable survivorship life insurance does not pay any benefit when the first policyholder dies.Variable survivorship life insurance is also called ""survivorship variable life insurance"" or ""last survivor life insurance.""","Like any variable life policy, variable survivorship life insurance has a cash value component in which a portion of each premium payment is set aside to be invested by the policyholder, who bears all investment risk. The insurer selects several dozen investment options from which the policyholder may choose. The other portion of the premium goes toward administrative expenses and the policy's death benefit (also called face value). This type of policy is legally considered a security, because of its investment component, and is subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission."
1019,Variable Universal Life Insurance (VUL),"Variable universal life (VUL) is a permanentlife insurance policy with a built-in savings component. The plan allows for the investment of the cash value. Like standard universal life insurance, the premium is flexible.",Variable universal life insurance has variablesub-accounts that allow for the investment of the cash value. The function of the sub-accounts is similar to amutual fund. Exposure to market fluctuations can generate significant returns but could also result in substantial losses.This insurance gets its name from the varying results of investment in the ever-fluctuating market.
1020,Vermin Exclusion,"A vermin exclusion is a provision of a property insurance policy that states that the policy will not pay benefits to the policyholder for damage caused by pests such as lice, fleas, roaches, bed bugs and rodents. Insurance companies commonly consider pest control to be part of ongoing maintenance, and do not view infestation as a peril to be insured against. Even if a policy does not have a vermin exclusion, the policyholder may find it difficult to prove the damage and loss caused by the vermin, so a policy may not pay out for vermin damage.","A vermin exclusion is a rider on a property insurance policy that excludes coverage for any damage caused by vermin, including rodents, insects or other pests. Vermin exclusions can be troublesome for property owners when the business that operates on the property is a restaurant, pet store or rental housing or other operation that is known to attract pests. Vermin will generally not limit their occupancy to the area that initially attracted them, but tend to spread throughout the entire property. Hotter and more humid areas of the country are also more likely to be breeding grounds for vermin, and it can be extremely difficult to protect from vermin and vermin damage in these climates. Vermin are difficult and costly to get rid of and pose liability issues for the property owner. It is precisely because they are so prevalent and cause so much costly damage that property insurance usually has an explicit or implied vermin exclusion. Insurance companies would lose too much on vermin-related claims, so it makes no sense from a risk and benefit perspective for a company to cover vermin damage."
1021,Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI),"Veterans group life insurance pays cash to the beneficiaries of a deceased member of the armed forces who had completed his or her service. Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI) is for service members who have completed their service and wish to continue to have life insurance coverage carried over from their Service members Group Life Insurance (SGLI) policy. They have one year and 120 days from the date they become veterans to exercise this option, and VGLI is a renewable term policy.","Veterans group life insuranceoffers many benefits not available in the private life insurance market. Premium rates are age-based only; they do not consider gender, tobacco use, job or recreational activities, all of which can increase premiums in the private market."
1022,Viatical Settlement,Aviatical settlement is anarrangement in which someone with a terminal disease sells his or her life insurance policy at a discount from its face value for ready cash. The buyer cashes in the full amount of the policy when the original owner dies. A viaticalsettlement is alsoreferred to as a life settlement.,A viatical settlement is extremely risky. The rate of return is unknown because it's impossible to know when someone will die.
1023,Viatication,"Viatication is the selling of a life insurance policy by a terminally ill person, so that person can receive a benefit from the policy while still alive and the purchaser of the policy can receive a payment when the seller dies.","Though viatication may seem quite morbid, it does benefit both the buyer and the seller. The purchaser pays the seller less than the full benefit of the policy in order to earn a return on the investment. The seller uses the proceeds to pay for medical treatments and/or improve quality of life whilewhen other sources of funds are exhausted. Viatication, also called a viatical settlement or life settlement, can also be used when the policyholder no longer wants the life insurance policy for any reason, even if he or she is not terminally ill."
1024,Viator,A viator is a person who has been diagnosed with a terminal or life-threatening illness and decides to sell theirlife insurancepolicy to take advantage of a portion of the death benefits. ,"The viator will need to find a person or entity willing to purchase their life insurance policy. This person or entity is known as a the viatical settlement provider (VSP). The VSP purchases the policy at a discount, paying the viator less that the actual value. The VSP then takes over the premium payments for the remainder of the victor's life. Upon the death of the viator, the VSP receives the fulldeath benefit."
1025,Vision Care Insurance,"Vision care insurance will often cover routine eye health expenses such as eye exams, contact lens fittings, contact lenses and eyeglass lenses and frames and may provide a discount on LASIK procedures. The plan may cover the cost of these items in full, up to a preset limit, or it may require the policyholder to pay a flat fee or percentage fee to share the expense with the insurer.","Vision care insurance tends to be inexpensive compared to other types of insurance, because many of the covered costs are predictable and expensive claims are rare. In fact, it more closely resembles a discount plan than a true insurance plan, because insurance is meant to protect against unforeseen and potentially catastrophic expenses."
1026,Voluntary Accidental Death And Dismemberment Insurance - VAD&D,Voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance (VAD&D) is a financial protection plan that provides a beneficiary with cash in the event that the policyholder is accidentally killed or loses a certain body part. VAD&D is a limited form of life insurance and is generally less expensive than a full life insurance policy.,"Voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance (VAD&D) is an optional benefit offered by some employers. Premiums are based on the amount of insurance purchased, and this type of insurance can make sense for workers in occupations that place them at high risk of physical injury. Most policies are renewed periodically with revised terms, although the client's consent with renewal is often implicitly assumed."
1027,Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association - VEBA,"Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) is a type of mutual organization that provides life, illness, accident, medical and similar benefits to members, their dependents or their beneficiaries.",A Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Assocation (VEBA)can be established by employees or by an employer and must consist of employees of the same company or same labor union. VEBA benefits normally end when the employee leaves the company or labor union with which the VEBA is associated.
1028,Voluntary Life Insurance,Voluntary life insurance is a financial protection plan that provides a cash benefit to a beneficiary upon the death of the insured. Voluntary life insurance is an optional benefit offered by employers. The employee pays a monthly premium in exchange for the insurer's guarantee of payment upon the insured's death. Employer sponsorship generally makes premiums for voluntary life insurance policies less expensive than individual life insurance policies sold in the retail market.,"Many insurers provide voluntary life insurance plans with additional benefits and riders. For example, a plan might feature the option to purchase insurance above the guaranteed issue amount. Depending on the amount of increase, the policyholder may be required to submit proof that they meetminimum health standards. Another is coverage portability, which is the ability of a policyholder to continue the life policy upon termination of employment. Each employer has their guidelines for porting apolicy. However, it is typically between 30-60 days after termination, and it requires the completion of paperwork."
1029,Voluntary Reserve,Voluntary reserve is a monetary reserves held by insurance companies. Government agencies often regulate the reserve requirements of financial institutions and insurance companies to ensure their solvency. Voluntary reserves are known as additionally held liquid assets.,"Insurance companies hold voluntary reserves to appear to be more financially stable and improve their liquidity ratios. Such requirements are often internally agreed upon by the insurer and not decided by law. State regulators use tools from the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, managed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)to determine the solvency of insurance companies."
1030,Waiting Period,A waiting period is the amountof time an insured must wait before some or all of their coverage comes into effect. The insured may not receive benefits for claims filed during the waiting period. Waiting periodsmay also be known as elimination periods and qualifying periods.,Policyholders need to consider their ability to pay for expenses when choosing the length of the waiting period for a policy.
1031,Waiver Of Coinsurance Clause ,"A waiver of coinsurance clause refers to language in a policy that states the insurance company will not require the policyholder to pay coinsurance, or a percentage of the total claim, under certain conditions.","In many property claims, a policyholder may receive, for example, only 80 percent coverage for their claims. In these cases, the homeowner is required to pay the remaining 20 percent in coinsurance. A waiver of coinsurance clause relinquishes the homeowners requirement to pay coinsurance. Generally, insurance companies tend to waive coinsurance only in the event of fairly small claims. In some cases, however, policies may include a waiver of coinsurance in the event of a total loss."
1032,Waiver Of Inventory Clause ,"A waiver of inventory clause in an insurance policy says that the insurance company will not require the policyholder to provide a written list of any damaged propertyduring an insured event. The waiver of inventory clause typically applesto certain types of claims, such as those for less than a specified amount. Waivers of inventory clauses also are foundin trusts and other legal contracts.","A waiver is a legally binding agreement in which the grantor voluntarily givesup a right. For example, a town might have a zoning ordinance that prohibits the establishment of a liquor store within 100 feet of a school. Lets say a business hoping to open a liquor store includes a parking lot with one edge that is 98 feet from a school. Given how close the business comes to meeting the restriction, and the fact that it is the parking lot and not the actual building within 98 feet of the school, the town might grant the business a waiver to the zoning law, allowing it to open. The town is under no obligation to do so as the ordinance plainly states a distance of 100 feet is required, but once granted the waiver becomes binding. A waiver of inventory clause likewise means that an entity with the right to demand an inventory of property agrees to forfeit that right."
1033,Waiver Of Premium For Disability ,"Waiver of premium for disability is a provision in an insurance policy that statesthe insurance company will not require the insured to pay the premiumif the they areseriously injured. Insurance companies can vary in their definition of a disability, and policies can vary on when and for how long they will waive a premium in the event of a disability. Also, insurance companies may charge a higher premium to include this waiver in the policy.","Two types of insurance policies that commonly include a waiver of premium for disability are life insurance and disability insurance. The waiver can mean the difference between the insured being able to keep the policy or having to give it up if he or she becomes disabled, is unable to work and no longer has an income. This waiver is particularly important for disability insurance because if the insured had to pay premiums after becoming disabled, they would not be protected against the peril they were trying to insure against."
1034,Waiver Of Premium For Payer Benefit ,"A waiver of premium for payer benefitclause in an insurance policysays that the insurance company will not require the insured to pay a fee to maintain the policy under certain conditions. Most commonly, these conditions are the death or disability of the person paying the insurance premiums. The insurance company may charge a higher premium to include this waiver in the policy to compensate for the additional risks presented with a waiver of premium for payer benefit.","As an example of a waiver of premium for payer benefit, considerif a parent or grandparent purchased a life insurance policy for their child or grandchild.The policy might contain a waiver of premium so that the child would continue to be covered even if the parent or grandparent died or became disabled and was no longer able to pay the premiums. The waiver might only apply until the child reached an age where he or she could be expected to pay the premiums alone, such as age 21."
1035,Waiver Of Restoration Premium ,Waiver of restoration premium is a section of an insurance policy that relates to continuation of coverage with a policy that has already paid out a claim.,"Waiver of restoration premium says that the insurance company will not require the policyholder to pay a fee to resume coverage at the same level which was in effect previously, and which their policy initially provided before any claims were paid out. In the absence of this clause, the customer may still be able to maintain the same level of coverage, but the insurer may require the covered party to pay an additional premium."
1036,Waiver of Premium Rider,"A waiver of premium rider is an insurance policy clause that waives premium payments in the event the policyholder becomes critically ill, seriously injured, or disabled. Other stipulations may apply, such as meeting specific health and age requirements. ",
1037,Waiver of Subrogation,"A waiver of subrogation is a contractual provision where an insured waives the right of his/her insurance carrier to seek redress, or seek compensation for losses, from a negligent third party.Typically, an additional fee is applied for this special policy endorsement. Many construction contracts and leases include waiver of subrogation clauses. Such provisions prevent one partys insurance carrier from pursuing a claim against the other contractual party in an attempt to recover money paid by the insurance company to its insured or to a third party in resolution of a covered claim.","A right of subrogation allows an insurer to stand in proxy for its insured after satisfying a claim paid to or on behalf of the insured in accordance with the companys duties under the insurance policy. The insurance company may then pursue whatever claim its insured asserts against other parties for that same loss, even when the loss involves resolution of claims brought against the insured. Because waivers of subrogation increase the insurer's risk by prohibiting the recovery of money paid to or on behalf of their insureds, insurance companies frequently charge an additional fee to the premium. Parties to the contract avoid litigation, and the insurance company bears the loss."
1038,Wanton Disregard ,"Wanton disregard is a legal term that denotes an individual's extreme lack of care for the well-being or rights of another individual. It is most commonly used in an insurance context involving negligenceto describe reckless behavior that has led to damages or injury.Wanton disregard is a very serious accusation that indicates that a person behaved extremely recklessly. Wanton disregard is not deliberately malicious, though it ismore serious than mere carelessness. In a lawsuit, wanton disregard might result in punitive damages depending on the severity of the situation and state laws. Wantondisregard may also be referred to as ""wanton conduct"" and may be more formally be expressed as ""willful and wanton disregard.""",
1039,War Damage Insurance Corporation,"The War Damage Insurance Corporation was a government financial protection arm created during World War II to provide coverage for war risks not covered by existing policies. The U.S. government provivded this coverage, to compensate American nationals for property damage caused by acts of war.","The creation of thiscorporation allowed the U.S. government to cover private property war losses, which private insurance didn't fully cover. The War Damage Insurance Corporation functioned like a private insurance company in that citizens had to purchase a policy with the company to be covered in the event of catastrophic loss related to the war."
1040,War Exclusion Clause,"A war exclusion clause in an insurance policyspecifically excludes coverage for acts of war such as invasion, insurrection, revolution, military coup and terrorism. A war exclusion clause in an insurance contract refers to protection for an insurer who will not be obligated to pay for losses caused by war-related events. Insurance companies commonly exclude coverage perils on whichthey cannot afford to pay claims.","Because most insurance companies would be unable to remain solvent, let alone profitable, if an act of war suddenly presented them with thousands or millions of expensive claims, auto, homeowners, renters, commercial property and life insurance policies often have war exclusion clauses. However, entities that are faced with a significant risk of war, such as companies located in politically unstable countries, may be able to purchase a separate war risk insurance policy."
1041,War Risk Insurance,"War risk insurance is a policy which provides financial protection to the policyholder against lossesfrom events such as invasions, insurrections, riots, strikes, revolutions, military coups and terrorism. Auto, homeowners, renters, commercial property, and life insurance policies often have act-of-war exclusions. With these exclusions, the policy will not pay for losses from war-related events. Because a standard insurance policy may specifically exclude war risk, it is sometimes possible to purchase a separate war risk insurance rider. ","Those entities which have risk exposure to the possibility of sudden and violent political upheavals are goodcustomers forwar risk insurance. For example, companies operating in politically unstable parts of the world have exposure to an elevated risk of loss from acts of war. War risk insurance may cover perils such as kidnappings and ransom, sabotage, emergency evacuation, worker injury, long-term disability, and loss or damage of property and cargo."
1042,Warehouse-To-Warehouse Clause ,A warehouse-to-warehouse clause in an insurance policyprovides for coverage of cargo in transit. A warehouse-to-warehouse clause usually covers cargo from the moment it leaves the origin-warehouse until the moment it arrives at the destination-warehouse. Separate coverage is necessary to insure the cargo while it is being stored in either warehouse.,"A warehouse-to-warehouse clause assures an exporter that their goods will arrive safely, not only at the port-of-destination, but also at the final destination warehouse. A warehouse-to-warehouse clause mitigates the financial risk an exporter carries oflosing a shipment at any point along the journey their goods travels to their final warehouse destination, which saves the shipper from untold amounts of difficulties and headaches."
1043,Warehouser's Liability Form ,"A warehousers liability form is a document that describes the obligations of a storage facility toward its customers. Warehouse owners and operators can be held liable if the goods being stored in their warehouse are destroyed, damaged or stolen. Thus, warehouser's liability insurance exists to protect owners and operators against the costs of legal defense, damage awards and other expenses related to a damage claim.","Warehousers liability forms vary from storage facility to storage facility. Also, certain types of property are commonly not covered by a standard form, including money, precious metals and stones. Once the owner removes his or her goods from the warehouse and signs a warehouse storage receipt and release of liability, the warehouse owner or operator is no longer responsible for the goods."
1044,Water Damage Clause,"A water damage clause is a clause in a property-casualty insurance contract. A water damage clause states that the insured is covered for water damage that occurs for specific reasons, such as frozen pipes or sewer backup. Water damage clauses are therefore usually included in most homeowners and renters' policies.","Water damage can be quite expensive to fix. For this reason, most homeowners and renters are willing to pay a higher price for a policy that includes this coverage. However, water damage clauses usually exclude damage from floods, for which a separate rider or policy must be purchased."
1045,Water Damage Insurance ,"Water damage insurance is a type of protection provided in most homeowners insurance policies against sudden and accidental water damage. Water damage insurance does not cover damage resulting from homeowner's negligence or failure to maintain the home in good repair. Moreover, flooding usually requires a separate policy if available.","As water damage insurance does not cover negligence, many types of water damage to real property can and should be avoided through proper maintenance. This can be anything like watching out for drippage from the ceiling during a rainstorm or a fixing a leaky pipe under the kitchen sink before mold becomes prevalent."
1046,Water Damage Legal Liability Insurance,"Water damage legal liability insurance is a policy that provides financial protection to a person or business that unintentionally causes water damage to the property of another. Not all policies include water damage legal liability insurance, so it is important that the insured read their insurance contract carefully to determine if this coverage is included.",Water damage legal liability insurance is a kind of liability insurance. Liability insurance is itself a kind of insurance policy that protects a an individual or business from the risk of being sued or being held legally liable for something. Liability insurance policies can cover both legal costs and any legal payouts for which the insured would be responsible if found legally liable.
1047,Water Exclusion Clause,"A water exclusion clause is a restriction in homeownersand rentersinsurance policies that denies coverage for some water-related claims. Types of water damage that are likely to fall under a water exclusion clause include damage caused by flood, tsunami, standing water, groundwater and drain or sewage backup.","A water exclusion clause is common in most insurance policies. The reasoning is that only specific areas are prone to water-related natural disaster events, such as floods, tidal waves or tsunamis. This clause is one of several types of exclusion clauses found in homeowners and renterpolicies. Other standard exclusions include earthquakes, certain government actions, landslides, nuclear hazards and wars."
1048,Water Pollution Liability,"Water pollution liability refers to the financial and legal responsibility for causing contamination to oceans, rivers, lakes, streams and underground aquifers. Businesses and other organizations that cause water pollution sometimes must pay for cleanup, as well as any damage to third-party property. Water pollution liability also includes third-party loss of revenue, loss of public services and damage to natural resources.","Water pollution liability applies to owners and operators of all sorts of commercial and recreational boats, as well as owners and operators of marinas and shipyards. Water pollution liability sometimes results in financial ruin for smaller businesses."
1049,Water Quality Insurance Syndicate (WQIS),"The Water Quality Insurance Syndicateis an American company that provides water pollution liability insurance for marine vessels. The Water Quality Insurance Syndicate (WQIS) provides coverage for marine cargo, vessels, tugboats, barges, fishing boats, ferries, yachts and more. Policies can cover any number of entities that might incur water pollution liability, including vessel owners and operators, cargo owners, shipyards, and marina owners and operators.","The Water Quality Insurance Syndicateis knownfor itsexperience and specializationinserving the marine industry.Insurance provided by theWater Quality Insurance Syndicate helps protect an entity that causes marine pollution from the significant expenses associated with cleanup, damage to third-party property, third party loss of revenue, regulatory fines and penalties and other threats. 15 marine insurance companies, including Navigators Insurance Company, New York Marine & General Insurance Company and North American Specialty Insurance Company, back WQIS. WQIS is also closely affiliated with the Marine Pollution Response Group, which provides oil-spill cleanup."
1050,Watercraft Insurance,"Watercraft insurance is an insurance policy that provides coverage for boats and personal watercraft. Watercraft insurance, also known as boat and personal watercraft insurance, often includes towing and wreckage removal, as well as fuel spill indemnification. This type of insurance may be purchased for sailboats, house boats, and pontoon boats, as well as other watercraft up to a certain size and value.","Watercraft insurance coverage and the types of coverage available usually vary according to the type of watercraft being insured. This is because different types of watercrafts carry different risks. For example, a sailboat and a pontoon boat are characteristically different types of watercraft. Watercraft insurance does not provide liability coverage for injuries caused by the operation of the boat or watercraft."
1051,Watercraft Nonowned Insurance ,"Watercraft nonowned insurance is a type of financial safeguard that covers marine vessels that are owned by someone other than the policyholder while they are being operated by the policyholder. Watercraft nonowned insurance is a type of property and casualty insurance, meaning that it covers physical property belonging to a person or business. Depending on the specific policy, watercraft nonowned insurance may cover physical damage, legal liability or both.","Watercraft nonowned insurance makes it easier for an operator of a watercraft to drive that watercraft even if they dont own the vehicle. For example, if the holder of a watercraft insurance policy borrowed a friend's boat, they would want to make sure their policy covered nonowned watercraft in case they had an accident while operating it. If the basic watercraft insurance policy does not include this coverage, it may be possible to add it via an endorsement or rider."
1052,Waterfall Concept,A waterfall concept is a life insurance plan that allows insurance holders to roll their policy over to a child or grandchild.,"A waterfall concept allows the child or grandchild of an individual with a tax-exempt whole-life insurance policy to receive the policy in a rollover transaction. Whole-life policies have two components. In addition to the death benefit that pays out when the insured passes away, whole-life policies also accumulate a tax-deferred cash value as the insured pays premiums. Eventually, the insured individual transfers the policy to a descendant, at which point the funds become taxable on withdrawal."
1053,Wear And Tear Exclusion ,"A wear and tear exclusion is aprovision of an insurance contract that states that the normal, expected deterioration of the insured object will not be covered by the insurance policy. Wear and tear is excluded from insurance policy coverage because it is inevitable. Insurance is designed to protect only against unforeseen losses. If insurance covered predictable losses, insurers would have to raise premiums dramatically to cover these expenses.","Wear and tear exclusions are fairly common.Auto insurance policies, for example, do not cover the replacement of auto parts that deteriorate with time and use, such as brake pads, timing belts and water pumps. Auto insurance policies only cover unpredictable events such as collisions. To prepare for predictable losses such as wear and tear, owners can self-insure by setting aside money each month."
1054,Weather Insurance,"Weather insurance is a type of protection against a financial loss that may be incurred because of rain, snow, storms, wind, fog, undesirable temperatures or other adverse, measurable weather conditions. Weather insurance is used to insure an expensive event that could be ruined by bad weather, like an outdoor wedding or an outdoor film production.","The premium for weather insurance is determined based on location and time of year, in other words, based on the likelihood of the insured weather event occurring and the amount of potential loss. Weather insurance is highly customizable, the insured can choose, for example, the number of days, weather events and severity of weather that will be covered by the policy."
1055,Weekly Premium Insurance ,"Weekly premium insurance is a type of financial protection where the payments that the insured makes in return for coverage are paid weekly. This type of insurance was introduced by Prudential in 1875 and was common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. At that time, insurers were unable to get insurance with monthly premium payments to catch on with consumers. The small weekly premium payments were designed to match up with workers' pay schedules and modest incomes. Also known as industrial life insurance.","Weekly premiums were a feature of industrial insurance, a type of life insurance product offered to workers employed in industrial jobs such as manufacturing. Insurance companies collected the premium payments by sending agents to people's homes. In the mid 1900s, the number of weekly premium insurance policies began to decline because rising incomes made larger and less frequent premium payments more affordable for many families."
1056,"Weight Of Ice, Snow Or Sleet Insurance ","Weight Of Ice, Snow Or Sleet Insurance is financial protection against damage caused to property by winter weather specifically, damage caused if a roof caves in because of the weight of ice, snow or sleet. This type of coverage is available through a residential or commercial real estate insurance policy. Depending on the insurer, this coverage may be included in a basic insurance policy, or it may need to be purchased separately.","The owner of a property in an area that is susceptible to winter storms should be aware of whether his or her basic hazard insurance policy covers damage caused by winter storms. Such damage can include wind damage, fallen trees, burst pipes and damage caused by snow, ice or sleet. It is also important to note whether the policy only covers damage to the structure or whether it also provides coverage for the contents of the structure."
1057,Wellness Program ,"An employer approach to improving employeehealth, wellness programs include activities such as company-sponsored exercise, weight-loss competitions, educational seminars, tobacco-cessation programs and health screenings that are designed to help employees eat better, lose weight and improve their overall physical health. Wellness programs often involve financial incentives for employees, such as lower health-insurance premiums or gift cards.","Besides improving employee productivity and decreasing sick days and leaves of absence, all of which reduce operating costs, wellness programs may be able to lower an organization'shealth insurance expenses.
